Saksynator#5566: Oh
Fletcha#9630: ?tag emojis
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Lida#6399: ?tag repl.it
R. Danny#6348: `repl.it` is just as worse, if not even worse than Heroku for hosting Discord bots.

**Why?**
To get your bot running 24/7, you need to run a webserver with your bot, which is a trivial task. Sure, you can pull it off, but why not use a cheap VPS instead? (`?tag vps`)
Repl.it also has some of the major disadvantages of Heroku (`?tag noheroku`)
Overall, it is a bad platform to host, and you should stay away from it.
Lida#6399: ?tag vps
R. Danny#6348: Need to run your bot 24/7? Get a cheap VPS.

<https://www.scaleway.com/>- Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by <https://online.net/>, based in Europe.
<https://www.digitalocean.com/> - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide.
<https://www.ovh.co.uk/> - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available.
<https://www.time4vps.eu/> - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania.
<https://www.linode.com/> - More cheap VPSes!
<https://www.vultr.com/> - US-based, DigitalOcean-like.
<https://galaxygate.net/> - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people.

Self-hosting:
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.

Free hosting:
No.  There is no good free VPS hoster, outside of persuading somebody to host for you, which is incredibly unlikely.

R. Danny#6348: Create your own help command by subclassing `HelpCommand` or `MinimalHelpCommand`, then passing it to `bot.help_command`:

```py
class MyHelpCommand(commands.MinimalHelpCommand):
    def get_command_signature(self, command):
        return '{0.clean_prefix}{1.qualified_name} {1.signature}'.format(self, command)

class MyCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self._original_help_command = bot.help_command
        bot.help_command = MyHelpCommand()
        bot.help_command.cog = self

    def cog_unload(self):
        self.bot.help_command = self._original_help_command
```
or, you can set the `help_command` kwarg to `None` when instantiating you `commands.Bot` instance, and write your own.

R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

Ava#4982: sewer main burst does sound bad
I’veGotABlankSpace#8100: <@!319753218592866315> you are the biggest asshole I have ever met. I have done nothing but be nice to you for as long as i've known you. I always stood up for you when people were being dicks to you, I tried to get you unbanned because I liked hanging out with you, I kept messaging you even though you didnt come back because i still wanted to talk to you. 

> don't bring him back
 I fought to get you unbanned, asking multiple times for you to come back, and yet the instant you come back after I get banned, you tell everyone to keep me banned. 

> it shouldn't be on us to keep him not being a dick
You call me a dick yet *YOU HAVENT BEEN IN THE FUCKING SERVER FOR OVER A GOD DAMN YEAR SO HOW THE FUCK WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN LIKE!*

> he stopped responding to my DMs which was sad because I did enjoy hearing him whine about how I have to come back
wow. is that all it was to you? whining? I was trying to be nice to you and stay friends with you, and you call that *whining*?

You know you were the one person who kept me from leaving this server back in 2018 when everyone was being mean to be because i didnt understand something? You were the only one who took the time to slow down and explain to me what I had to do and why I was messing up. That's why I stayed. Because I saw that there was at least one person who was nice and I could trust. If only I had known how wrong I was back then I could've saved the past year and a half of my life.

Dimbreath#0424: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Dutchy#6127: ?tag import
R. Danny#6348: If you need to import a variable from a different python file, it's pretty easy. In your external file, have a variable and set its value (in this example we'll be using a token, and our file name is called `myfile.py`):
```py
token = "blah blah blah" <-- inside of myfile.py
```
Now, in your main file, you can import the file (by name) and get the token by an attribute of the file:
```py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import myfile # <-- import your external file here

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

# code

bot.run(myfile.token)
```
Now, get your ass on some Python learning websites you filthy prick:

Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.

Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.

```There are 3 downsides to using this method.
1) The converters (the type hints) won't be triggered. You need to pass the correct types into the arguments.
2) Checks will be bypassed. You could invoke an owner only command with a non owner and it would still work.
If you still want to run all the checks, see `?rtfm Command.can_run`, which will run all the checks and raise an error if any checks fail.
3) If ctx.invoke was invoked outside of a command (eg eval), the error handler wont fire.

R. Danny#6348: Checks are a way of limiting a command's use in a certain situation.
D.py has a list of inbuilt checks you can find here <https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html#checks>

A check is applied to a command through the use of decorators. These go above or below the command decorator as like in the example bellow. You can have multiple checks for one command.
```py
@bot.command()
@commands.has_role("Cool Dudes")
async def hello():
```
Checks call also be global or cog wide. See `?tag locational checks`
D.py implements a custom check system if the in built checks are insufficient. See `?tag better custom checks toad`

Kaylynn#4444: i'm so goddamn confused
i'm just trying to call a predicate
why are the wrong errors getting raise
Cy#2501: Wat error
Kaylynn#4444: just a base CheckFailure
Kaylynn#4444: when it should be MissingRequiredPermissions or etc
Kaylynn#4444: <cradd

Cy#2501: Is that your custom check
Kaylynn#4444: it's an issue with my custom check yes
Equity#3464: any mongodb users?

MrHouck#6432: yikes
Equity#3464: ok dad so
Kaylynn#4444: but it's not my check that's causing issues
Equity#3464: uh fuck i forgot question
Cy#2501: <:waitwhat:596577409768226816>
Equity#3464: oh yea
Kaylynn#4444: it's uh commands.has_permissions
Kaylynn#4444: i'm trying to call the redicate for it
Equity#3464: since u use motor, how would u detect if the lib is actually connected to mongo
Kaylynn#4444: and i'm getting CheckFailured'd instead of MissingRequiredPermissions'd
Equity#3464: and how does mongo handle stuff when i try to grab shit from nested dicts that may not be nested
Xua#1137: ```py
        try:
            await self.db.abyss.accounts.find_one({})
            self.log.info("MongoDB connection success")
            # dummy query to ensure the db is connected
        except Exception as exc:
            self.log.error("COULD NOT CONNECT TO MONGODB DATABASE.")```
Cy#2501: Not sure
Equity#3464: okie
Xua#1137: why are you calling the check manually <@!636797375184240640> ?
Equity#3464: i think i answered the other question
Cy#2501: What

Kaylynn#4444: <@!455289384187592704> it's for setting per-server command usage requirements
so i have a deco that will check the user-set requirements, and if those aren't present, it'll check the check provided as an arg in the decorator
Xua#1137: why not use `Command.can_run`?
Equity#3464: im so glad that i dont have to look up anymore sql
A Discord User#5290: ?rtfm on_message_remove
R. Danny#6348: Could not find anything. Sorry.
Cy#2501: Todo add Use `can_run` instead of calling internal `predicate`
Todo#9724: Todo task successfully added!
A Discord User#5290: ?rtfm on_message_delete
R. Danny#6348: 
Kaylynn#4444: can_run isn't right for what i'm doing i don't think
because if a user can't use the command with the default requirements (has_permissions in this case) but can use it with the server-specific requirements, it will still fail

R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

R. Danny#6348: `discord.Message` doesn't implement `==`, so `message1 == message2` is not possible.

You should probably compare ids (`message1.id == message2.id`).

This is a hotly debated issue which is why `==` hasn't be added to messages yet. (See Issue #772)

PixelatedToast#9650: ?tag reaction
R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

R. Danny#6348: **Trying to get reactions from a message but getting nothing back?** You need to re-fetch the message - this is because reactions aren't automatically added to existing message objects as they come in.
```python

    msg = await ctx.send('React to this message.')
    await msg.add_reaction("✅")

hi
type hints
xenonsb#9313: ?tag type hints
R. Danny#6348: An example of what a type hint is:

```py
async def command(ctx, member: discord.Member):
```

In discord.py, this will attempt to convert your variable to the type that you are specifcying. In this example, it will attempt to convert the string from the message to a `Member`. For example:

```
!command @R. Danny#6348 
# or
!command 80528701850124288
# or
!command "R. Danny"
# This will end up making the member variable declared in the command a `Member` object
```

In normal python, this does not do anything except for documentation purposes. It allows interpretation of the methods, in order to know what type a variable in the parameters is meant to be. IE an IDE is able to tell you you're passing the wrong variable type, based on this.

Kaylynn#4444: get your cold dead hands off of me
Eugene#3778: ?tag spoonfeeding
R. Danny#6348: **The simple answer as to why we do not spoonfeed, is it does not help you learn.**

If you come in this server and ask a question that has a very basic answer, and you do not know how to figure out this answer...then put quite bluntly, you need to learn more. What we will do, is point you in the right direction to learn what you need to. By simply giving an answer that you, most likely, cannot then figure out *why* it is the correct answer....you learn absolutely nothing.

All developers need to learn some very basic things:
**How to read docs**
**How to read tracebacks/errors**
**How to figure out *where* to look**
    Would your question be better suited to simply google?
    Is your question in the docs, quite clearly?
    If you think about your question, do you think it's probably been asked many times before? Have you tried the FAQ?

Whenever you are "not spoonfed", you are being assisted in how to do one of the above. Don't be unnapreciative, it is the type of help you need, whether you want to admit it or not.

See: `?tag a real token` for an example token.

taaal#6666: ?tag help
R. Danny#6348: **A simple guide to getting help**

In order for us to help, we need relevant information.

Have an error/issues? **Provide the full traceback output. Show code around the error, and any relevant code.**
Something happening different than expected? **Explain what's expected, then compare to what is actually happening.**

Keep in mind that we are not you, we cannot read your mind, and saying something like "My code doesn't work!" or "I have an error." or "This code is broken, why?" or "Can somebody help me?" gives absolutely nothing, and is just annoying. You must provide information that we need in order to look into whatever your question is.

As a courtesy to others, please refrain from pasting large codeblocks into chat. If it's big enough, you will annoy other users in the channel. Please use services such as <https://hastebin.com>, <https://gist.github.com> or <https://ghostbin.com>.

If you don't know Python, hop into <#381963689470984203> and run `?tag lp`. Without a solid knowledge in Python, we cannot properly assist you. Yes, it will take months. Coding isn't just gluing text together. It takes time and patience — months or years.

R. Danny#6348: To shard your bot:
```bot = commands.AutoShardedBot(
    command_prefix="?",
    description="An AutoShardedBot.")```

__Sharding__
Sharding is a nice way to split your bot to smaller, more manageable parts. It is recommended to only use this feature with big bots (1000 guilds or more).

Dutchy#6127: Why use requests
Sebastiano#5005: how should I do that?
Dutchy#6127: ?tag requests
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

lambda#0987: ?tag why rewrite
R. Danny#6348: **Why migrate to the new stable discord.py v1.0 (previously rewrite branch)?**
  • Better documentation 
  • `ctx` always passed
  • `ctx` new shortcuts
  • Websocket reconnections
  • Model-based API
  • Ability for sub-commands to not invoke parent
  • Async checks and events
  • Case insensitive commands
  • NSFW channel checking
  • Full category support
  • Animated emoji support
  • Audit log support
  • Webhook support
  • Improved activity support
  • New raw events and functions
  • Bot and Cog Template creator
  • Python 3.7 compatibility
  • Jumplink support
  • `Guild.get_role` method for O(1) role fetching
  • New Union, Optional, Greedy Converters
  • New Cog model with new methods, cog names and cog-wide command attribute setting
  • Improved bulk message delete handling

Migrating Guide: <https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html>
lambda#0987: ?tag why not rewrite
R. Danny#6348: **Why not?**
Rewrite is stable, but still in active development. It is discouraged to use if:
   • You won't keep your library up to date
   • You won't keep your code up to date with any breaking changes
   • You won't subscribe to news of breaking changes with `?rewrite`
   • You don't want to rewrite your existing code to be compatible

Mellow#0025: ?tag abuse
R. Danny#6348: Discord has a very loose interpretation of API abuse; as quoted by them:

```
American Jake01/21/2018
@Danny automating the API in that way /is/ abuse. Automatically doing "X" every N is generally not a good idea. Where X could be posting a message, changing someone's nickname, renaming a role, changing a channel topic, etc... 

Generally bots should only react to user actions... 

Although, for very large N we generally don't care. But for small N, we do care. Think rainbow bots, etc....
```

"N" is not really defined, as rate limits are not a good thing to try to get very close to. You're going to have to mostly use common sense here, compare how close you are the rate limit, how often you do this, etc.

R. Danny#6348: **Looking to set up a Lavalink server?**
It's pretty simple to do so, and I'll show you here.

**Setup**
Download the latest `Lavalink.jar` from <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases> here and place an `application.yml` file in the same directory. The file should look like <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example> this.

**Starting it**
Cd into your lavalink directory: e.g `cd <directory>`
Run `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
Check that it started successfully.
*You preferably, should use a process manager for this in the future*

**Using it!**
See `?tag lavalink.py` for more information on Lavalink.py, `?tag pylava` for info on the Pylava library, or `?tag waterlink` for more info on the Waterlink library.

Infinity#1806: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

For reasons, see `?tag noheroku` or `?tag dannycalmlyexplainswhyherokuisbad` or `?tag dannyexplainswhyherokuisbadbutitsnotdannyitsdevonssignificantlyandobjectivelybettertag`
SebbyLaw#2597: ?tag noheroku
R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

clam#5985: should I learn c++?
clam#5985: idk if im ready or whatever. ive heard it's a pretty steep learning curve
Equity#3464: you're always ready
Equity#3464: just gotta put some effort into learning it
clam#5985: can I use vscode
Equity#3464: ya
clam#5985: awesome
clam#5985: ill start tomorrow
Equity#3464: unless you wanna use visual studio which is absolute garbage for cross platform dev
clam#5985: i dont like vs
Nomad#2440: ?tag db
R. Danny#6348: Want to store your data? Here are some ways:
Format: `**DB** -- python libraries to interface with it`

**PostgreSQL** -- `asyncpg` (good for general use)
**MySQL** -- `aiomysql`
**SQLite** -- `aiosqlite` (good if your bot is small and/or private)

Note while JSON *can* be used if it's a small/simple bot, care must be taken in order to avoid losing your data.
Equity#3464: just use mingw since it provides all the tools for c and c++ dev

clam#5985: ive technically been programming for like 10
Equity#3464: i've been programming for 2
IAmTomahawkx#1000: but only the last like 5 months has been comprehensible python
clam#5985: but really programming for like 3
Equity#3464: html was my first language
IAmTomahawkx#1000: cause it was all self taught
Equity#3464: then css
Equity#3464: then python
clam#5985: i started learning js when I was like 5

Cy#2501: I started programming a year ago lol

IAmTomahawkx#1000: ?tag raw oop
R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of \`object\`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a \`Class\` and an \`instance\` .

A \`Class\` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a \`Class\` of \`Fruit\`....an instance of this class could be \`apple\`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
\`discord.Guild.id\`

This \`id\` attribute is an attribute  of the class \`Guild\`....This means to use it you must have an \*\*instance\*\* of the \`discord.Guild\` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: \`message.guild\` through searching by id \`client.get\_guild(id)\` etc.

TL;DR: \*\*OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.\*\*
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

Format: `**DB** -- python libraries to interface with it`

**PostgreSQL** -- `asyncpg` (good for general use)
**MySQL** -- `aiomysql`
**SQLite** -- `aiosqlite` (good if your bot is small and/or private)

Note while JSON *can* be used if it's a small/simple bot, care must be taken in order to avoid losing your data.

IAmTomahawkx#1000: pip install supervisorctl right?
Xua#1137: just supervisor i think
Equity#3464: tbh just use ur os repos
Xua#1137: bleh no
Xua#1137: those are usually outdated
Xua#1137: plus installs unnecessary python versions sometimes
Xua#1137: pip version just works straight out of the box
IAmTomahawkx#1000: is there a setup.py?
IAmTomahawkx#1000: it didnt run one
Xua#1137: nop
Xua#1137: well
Xua#1137: there is
Xua#1137: but it has no unneeded setup
Equity#3464: tru
Xua#1137: once you call `supervisord`, you can call `supervisorctl` to load the cli
IAmTomahawkx#1000: theres no supervisord bash thingy tho
Xua#1137: did you install it globally
IAmTomahawkx#1000: yeh
Xua#1137: ie in root / without --user
IAmTomahawkx#1000: 
IAmTomahawkx#1000: oh

Cy#2501: ?tag systemd howto
R. Danny#6348: First create a `.service` file, located in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. You can find a template for it by doing `?tag systemd example` (in <#381963689470984203> of course).
Now assuming the file is named `mybot.service`, run these commands:
- Reload systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
- Start you bot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mybot
```
- If you want it to automatically start on boot:
```bash
systemctl enable mybot
```
And that's basically it. Of course, this tag doesn't cover all what systemd can do. You can get more info by visiting the systemd wiki: <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>

Cy#2501: ?tag systemd howto
R. Danny#6348: First create a `.service` file, located in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. You can find a template for it by doing `?tag systemd example` (in <#381963689470984203> of course).
Now assuming the file is named `mybot.service`, run these commands:
- Reload systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
- Start you bot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mybot
```
- If you want it to automatically start on boot:
```bash
systemctl enable mybot
```
And that's basically it. Of course, this tag doesn't cover all what systemd can do. You can get more info by visiting the systemd wiki: <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>

R. Danny#6348: Tag not found. Did you mean...
supervisord howto
super
Cy#2501: ?tag supervisord howto
R. Danny#6348: Install it with pip

``pip install supervisor``

Run ``echo_supervisord_conf > /etc/supervisord.conf`` to get a basic supervisord conf file, it also can be in whatever dir you want, this is the default one. 

Append this to it. 
```ini
[program:bot]
command=/bin/bash -c 'source venv/bin/activate && venv/bin/python bot.py'  ; activate venv and start bot
directory=/full/path/to/bot ; if you dont want to always run supervisord from the specific directory set this
autostart=true ; start the bot as soon as you launch supervisord
autorestart=true ; restart the bot when the process dies
stopsignal=int
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true ; for cleaning up and avoid spawning multiple processes
stderr_logfile=/etc/logs/botstderr.log ; log to a file
stdout_logfile=/etc/logs/botstdout.log ; log to a file
```

Then, in your bot's directory run ``supervisord``. If supervisord.conf is not in the ``/etc`` dir make sure to to include the ``-c path/to/file.conf`` flag. 

You can then use ``supervisorctl`` to check the status of your processes, restart, stop or start them.

For more config options check out the official docs http://supervisord.org/configuration.html

□ | The Cosmos#6811: ?tag blocking
R. Danny#6348: **Using blocking code in your bot?**
Code that is computationally intensive or slow such as PIL, blocks the entire event loop, meaning that your bot cannot process other events, such as messages, during the time that the blocking code is running. If you want to run synchronous code asynchronously, you will need to do it in another thread. Using `await loop.run_in_executor(None, sync_func, *args)` does this for you.

R. Danny#6348: Need to run your bot 24/7? Get a cheap VPS.

<https://www.scaleway.com/>- Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by <https://online.net/>, based in Europe.
<https://www.digitalocean.com/> - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide.
<https://www.ovh.co.uk/> - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available.
<https://www.time4vps.eu/> - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania.
<https://www.linode.com/> - More cheap VPSes!
<https://www.vultr.com/> - US-based, DigitalOcean-like.
<https://galaxygate.net/> - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people.

Self-hosting:
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.

Free hosting:
No.  There is no good free VPS hoster, outside of persuading somebody to host for you, which is incredibly unlikely.
Soheab_#5757: ?tag jishaku
R. Danny#6348: jishaku is a debugging and experimenting cog for Discord bots using discord.py@rewrite.
Note that this only works with Python 3.6+ and discord.py rewrite.
You can install it by running the following:
```
pip install -U jishaku
```or
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku
```
To get the cog running, simply do
```
bot.load_extension('jishaku')
```
You can see the source code yourself here: <https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku>

flapili#5132: ?tag db
R. Danny#6348: Want to store your data? Here are some ways:
Format: `**DB** -- python libraries to interface with it`

**PostgreSQL** -- `asyncpg` (good for general use)
**MySQL** -- `aiomysql`
**SQLite** -- `aiosqlite` (good if your bot is small and/or private)

Note while JSON *can* be used if it's a small/simple bot, care must be taken in order to avoid losing your data.

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+i
2. Click "Network" tab
3. If you do not see any rows, start typing in a channel to generate a network request
4. Click on one of the rows
5. Scroll down to "Request headers"

R. Danny#6348: Discord disabled the easy route of getting your token via `Application`, so I've provided 2 other ways of doing it. Please note, self-bots are against the TOS, so make sure not to use them! 
**Method 1:**

`1` Press CTRL + Shift + I
`2` Find "Network"
`3` At the top type in "/api/v6"
`4` Type a few letters so this appears: http://i.emil.ink/u/DiscordCanary_2019-05-09_18-43-58.png
`5` Scroll to the bottom where it says `Request Headers` and copy the `authorization:` code (that's your token)

**Method 2:**
`1` Open CTRL + Shift + I
`2` Go to "Application Tab"
`3` Expand Local Storage > https://discordapp.com/ 
`4` Log out of Discord
`5` Log back into Discord
`6` Your token will be there, and you can copy and paste it now.

R. Danny#6348: **Oh no! You just leaked your bot token!**

You accidentally gave out your token in a screenshot or in your code and forgot to remove the token! What does that do?
Well, it leads to letting users access your bot acccount/controlling it.
Don't worry, you can reset your token anytime!

You only have to go on **https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/** and generate a new token under the bot tab.

Make sure next time you don't leak your bot token.
Always keep in mind that you have to remove the bot token before taking a screenshot or sending your code to get help.

F4zi.#1107: ?tag class
R. Danny#6348: A class is a very important part of Python. If you don't know anything about Python, please take the time to learn it (run `?tag lp`).
**What is a class?**
A class is a way of creating objects. The object have variables and behaviors within them.
**How do I make one?**
You can create a class by using the keyword `class`
**Show me an example**
Sure, anything to make this tag longer
```py
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def test(self):
        print("Looks it works! :)")

# Create an instance of a class
example = Example()
example.test()
```

F4zi.#1107: ?tag instance
MrSnek#3442: ?rtfm load_ext
R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

Lida#6399: ?tag reactionroles
R. Danny#6348: To create a "reaction roles" system you need to wait on reactions on older messages- which will not be in the 5000(default) long cache discord.py maintains- and if a message is not in the cache, `on_reaction_add` will not dispatch for reactions added to that message.

To resolve this, on the **async branch** you can use `on_socket_raw_receive` and parse the events "manually", and get the "raw event" that way- see `?tag on_socket_raw_receive`, which will provide you with several dicts with relevant IDs.
On the **rewrite branch**, `on_raw_reaction_add` is provided, which will trigger for all reactions regardless of cache, and provides you a `RawReactionActionEvent` object containing relevant IDs.

Use the IDs in these objects to filter out reactions relevant to messages and emojis you care about, and get relevant role/member objects.

R. Danny#6348: **A simple guide to getting help**

In order for us to help, we need relevant information.

Have an error/issues? **Provide the full traceback output. Show code around the error, and any relevant code.**
Something happening different than expected? **Explain what's expected, then compare to what is actually happening.**

Keep in mind that we are not you, we cannot read your mind, and saying something like "My code doesn't work!" or "I have an error." or "This code is broken, why?" or "Can somebody help me?" gives absolutely nothing, and is just annoying. You must provide information that we need in order to look into whatever your question is.

As a courtesy to others, please refrain from pasting large codeblocks into chat. If it's big enough, you will annoy other users in the channel. Please use services such as <https://hastebin.com>, <https://gist.github.com> or <https://ghostbin.com>.

If you don't know Python, hop into <#381963689470984203> and run `?tag lp`. Without a solid knowledge in Python, we cannot properly assist you. Yes, it will take months. Coding isn't just gluing text together. It takes time and patience — months or years.

nx#1674: ?tag database
R. Danny#6348: <https://www.postgresql.org/> - Widely used, open source database with good data integrity and feature set. The typical recommendation for bots.
<https://www.mysql.com/> - The de facto SQL standard in software development. Usually not recommended here due to the decreased feature set in comparison to PostgreSQL, but strongly time-tested.
<https://www.sqlite.org/index.html> - File-based DB, no authentication. Lack of networking means query-by-query time is relatively fast, but tends to chug past a certain amount of load.

i want to delete this message sent by user where he/she used the command
Arcane#0033: OH
😉 Ashu 😉#0690: i know there is self.purge or self.delete
Arcane#0033: just do ctx.message.delete()
😉 Ashu 😉#0690: 🤔
Arcane#0033: inside the command
😉 Ashu 😉#0690: Oh ty
Arcane#0033: np
Arcane#0033: but wait... <@!563143458806824980>
Arcane#0033: idk for real but it might delete the message object
Arcane#0033: so you might not be able to access ctx.message again
Arcane#0033: so you might want to store the information from the message you need in variables

Danny#0007: Hello, the first event is officially over 🎉

It ran a *little* bit longer than I originally wanted due to some sudden real life circumstances but hopefully it was still fun for everyone involved. First some data:

Feb 6: 63 Infected, 1 Death
Feb 7: 41 Infected, 0 Deaths
Feb 8: 95 Infected, 19 Deaths
Feb 9: 53 Infected, 2 Deaths
Feb 10: 50 Infected, 24 Deaths
Feb 11: 44 Infected, 12 Deaths
Feb 12: 37 Infected, 12 Deaths
Feb 13: 14 Infected, 43 Deaths
Totals: 397 Infected, 113 Deaths

Top curers are AnonymousDapper#7467 and Cute#0313 being tied for 10.  Total number of people cured by someone else is 62. A little overinflated due to bugs though.

Top killers are tied between Kaleido 𒆙 Cli#2705 and AXVin#2130, both with 4. The total number of people killed by someone else is 27.

The person who infected the most people is apple502j#6852 with 11. Second place doesn't even come close at 2 infected. The total number of people infected by someone else is 36.

I don't have per-day statistics on being cured (sorry) but the total of cured users is 108. This number might be a little overinflated since there were a few bugs with the hug command.

The code for the bot will be public at some point. I've prepared a longer Q&A if you're curious about certain things here: <https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/623debe0433d064ec263f6da00666de4>

As for feedback, if you liked this event and would want to see more in the future (with completely different themes etc) then react to this with a <:upvote:596577438461591562> , otherwise react with a <:downvote:596577438952062977> .

Gobot1234#2435: im not that dumb
devon#4089: oh i see it's string literal concat abuse
LyricLy#5695: now this code is kinda bad
MrSnek#3442: Jesus
Shiney#0001: mmmmm
LyricLy#5695: remember what I just said about no list comprehensions
LyricLy#5695: yea
Danny#0007: eh
devon#4089: <@!319753218592866315> it's fine as long as it's not the only thing in your f-string
Danny#0007: this isn't really abuse
Danny#0007: lol
LyricLy#5695: oh I get what you mean
MrSnek#3442: `client.user.friends` <:thonkeng:582078279301726258>
Gobot1234#2435: its not dpy
LyricLy#5695: like putting sole code in an f string
devon#4089: yes
Danny#0007: it ain't me
LyricLy#5695: technically faster than casting to string sometimes though isn't it
devon#4089: `f'{<a string>}'` is pointless
devon#4089: str.join returns a string
Gobot1234#2435: thats big brain
LyricLy#5695: very true
devon#4089: so you gain nothing from this except from i guess the concat stack above
LyricLy#5695: the one thing I hate in Python is string literal autoconcat
LyricLy#5695: dumb
Gobot1234#2435: yes
devon#4089: it's useful sometimes
Shiney#0001: ```py
>>> f"{'string'}"
'string'``` i have released my anger
devon#4089: yes this hurts me
devon#4089: very much
Gobot1234#2435: is beatiful
MrSnek#3442: Was it too much trouble to use triple quotes?
devon#4089: f-strings as triple quotes makes visual alignment look terrible
devon#4089: but that aside
devon#4089: triple quotes also consume whitespace
Ava#4982: I see a lot of people do `f'{stuff}'` for some reason

Shiney#0001: oh right

Shiney#0001: i generally dislike f-strings anyway so
devon#4089: it hurts me when the thing inside the expression returns a string
LyricLy#5695: how does the bot have friends?
devon#4089: like with the str.join case
Gobot1234#2435: <@!310418322384748544> do you prefer .format
Shiney#0001: yes
devon#4089: it's literally already a string
Gobot1234#2435: <@!319753218592866315> its steam
devon#4089: shiney why are you against f-strings
devon#4089: they're shorter to write and faster at runtime
Shiney#0001: they look stupid and people abuse them
devon#4089: but shiney
Shiney#0001: if i wanted fast i'd use c
devon#4089: i can do `f"The current date is {datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}"
devon#4089: aint that fuckin suck
Shiney#0001: most of my time is spent **reading** code
if your stupid f-strings are my bottleneck for reading your code
i will despise you and your code
devon#4089: in my opinion this ^ is much more readable than the .format alternative
Shiney#0001: that looks okay devon
Shiney#0001: yes
Shiney#0001: but people take it far further than that
Gobot1234#2435: do run py
print(f"The current date is {datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}")
RTFM#1338: ```ph
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".code.tio", line 1, in <module>
    print(f"The current date is {datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}")
NameError: name 'datetime' is not defined

Exit code: 1```
Shiney#0001: you'll see a full line of code in the string and think "what the fuck does this do"
Ryan#5872: abusing convenience is the main issue of it
Shiney#0001: mostly because my ide doesn't actualy syntax highlight f-strings lol
Gobot1234#2435: do run py import datetime
print(f"The current date is {datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}")
devon#4089: if you're heaping statements in there then you're just really bad at code readability
RTFM#1338: ```ph
The current date is 2020-02-13

Exit code: 0```
ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag permissions
R. Danny#6348: To see all available permissions in the Discord API and calculate the correct permission value for Permissions objects or Oauth URLs, use the following website:
<https://discordapi.com/permissions.html>
Shiney#0001: mhm
Shiney#0001: this is my main problem
ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag permission overwrite
R. Danny#6348: **How to set permissions overwrites for bots™**

Permissions overwrites are permissions specific to a channel which override the default ones.
If you want to edit the overwrites for a specific member you can do something like this
```py
overwrite = discord.PermissionOverwrite() # can also be discord.PermissionOverwrite(send_messages=False, ...) 
overwrite.send_messages = False
overwrite.read_messages = True
await channel.set_permissions(member, overwrite=overwrite)```or 
```py
await channel.set_permissions(member, read_messages=True, send_messages=False)```

When creating a channel though, it's a bit different. You have to provide a dictionary where each key is the target and each value a discord.PermissionOverwrite object, like this:
```py
overwrites = {
    guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=False),
    guild.me: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True)
}

await guild.create_text_channel('bot-only', overwrites=overwrites)```
In both cases, if you want to delete them set the ``overwrite`` kwarg to ``None``.

You **cannot** set or edit overwrites through ``channel.edit()`` and you **must** have the ``manage_channels`` permissions so set/change them.
Shiney#0001: no they're bad because of the people who use them c:
Shiney#0001: that's how this works
devon#4089: i want to hear your opinions on religion shiney
Shiney#0001: fwiw i'm kidding
Shiney#0001: also lol
Shiney#0001: devon i think i may have made my handshake not fucked
devon#4089: yeah? run it by me
Shiney#0001: first, i forgot how you figure out the server to connect to
Shiney#0001: don't you need the room code for this
devon#4089: i forget let me check my own lib
Shiney#0001: alr
LyricLy#5695: <@122122926760656896> I did not know you could do that, that is fukin sick
LyricLy#5695: the datetime thinf
LyricLy#5695: strftime with __format__
devon#4089: 
devon#4089: yes you need the room code
Shiney#0001: dumb
Shiney#0001: have you ever seen it not be ecast?
Shiney#0001: because that's what i've hardcoded
devon#4089: well it needs to connect you to the right server that's hosting your game
devon#4089: the framework they are using does not mandate that it is ecast so your code should not assume that is ecast
devon#4089: opportunity for it to fail sometime in the future inexplicably
Shiney#0001: yeah i know this
devon#4089: blobcast is the only URL suitable for hardcoding and you only need to communicate with it once to know where you need to be from then on

Shiney#0001: checks out
LyricLy#5695: shiney
LyricLy#5695: eyes were closed sorry
Shiney#0001: did you just fucking call me whiney lmao
Shiney#0001: best misspelling of my nam

devon#4089: what port are you connecting to
Shiney#0001: uh lemme check

devon#4089: yes it's expecting the time
Shiney#0001: how's that look
devon#4089: i dunno how it reacts without it but the official client passes it
Anakin#1267: ?rtfm guildinfo
R. Danny#6348:

devon#4089: ?t=<unix integer timestamp in milliseconds>
Shiney#0001: i have no idea what purpose is serves
devon#4089: "javascript time" as we call it
Shiney#0001: how do you propose i get javascript time in python :')
devon#4089: int(time.time() * 1000)
Shiney#0001: `wss://{0}:{1}/socket.io/1/websocket/{2}`
Shiney#0001: and this is the wss to connect to
Arcane#0033: wew
Shiney#0001: is my handshake okay now >:c ~~after i add time param~~
devon#4089: yes but you are supposed to validate your session code
Shiney#0001: how in the world do i do that
Nivrak#6560: ?rtfm on_message
R. Danny#6348: 
Poteto143#1434: e!info
devon#4089: the /socket.io/1 returns <session_code>:60:60:<other_info>
Shiney#0001: yeah
devon#4089: <other_info> needs to contain `websocket` for it to be a valid socket and you should probably check the numbers are right too
Shiney#0001: `code:60:60:websocket,flashsocket`
Shiney#0001: what're the numbers
devon#4089: i am not sure because the original code doesn't help explain them
devon#4089: they don't appear to be important other than they're consistent
Shiney#0001: so they're always 60?
devon#4089: yes
Shiney#0001: easy enough
Shiney#0001: so, add time, check `...:60:60:websocket,flashsocket`
devon#4089: yes
Shiney#0001: woo
devon#4089: then when you connect to the socket you should check the first thing you receive is `1::`
devon#4089: and your immediate response to it should be the JoinRoom action including your name and room code
Shiney#0001: actually should i be checking `websocket,flashsocket` or just `websocket`
devon#4089: websocket is the only one that matters
Shiney#0001: got it, then steal the first recv and check it's `1::`
devon#4089: flashsocket is presumably for if the player is using flash
devon#4089: probably old version stuff
Shiney#0001: i see
devon#4089: if you do that and send the right JoinRoom code and heartbeat 📥 `2:::` 📤 `2::`
devon#4089: then your handshake is ok
devon#4089: also use blobcast
Cy#2501: K.sockres
Kanade#5520: 
Shiney#0001: blobcast thing is annoying
Shiney#0001: i connect in `connect()` and i join in `join(code)` lol
i'd have to merge them to choose a server from the room code :c
Cy#2501: K.snipe <#381965515721146390>

devon#4089: just store it on your class then
Shiney#0001: this doesn't change anything lol
Shiney#0001: connect comes before join
Shiney#0001: and would need the code join gets
Shiney#0001: <:dabThinkGlare:454742395662106625>
devon#4089: wtf is your control flow man

devon#4089: def connect():
    self.server_location = ...
Shiney#0001: <:dabThinkGlare:454742395662106625>
devon#4089: yes you need this anyway
Shiney#0001: ```
connect() # doesn't get the room code
join("....") # does```
Shiney#0001: i do not usually need this until i am *joining*
devon#4089: how are you getting your app id
Shiney#0001: why would i need appId
Shiney#0001: also it would be in join if i do lol
devon#4089: because you need to send it back on the websocket
Shiney#0001: y'know after you join an "app"

R. Danny#6348: jishaku is a debugging and experimenting cog for Discord bots using discord.py@rewrite.
Note that this only works with Python 3.6+ and discord.py rewrite.
You can install it by running the following:
```
pip install -U jishaku
```or
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku
```
To get the cog running, simply do
```
bot.load_extension('jishaku')
```

Programmer#5648: ?tag custom emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Kaylynn#4444: ?tag lavalink
R. Danny#6348: **Looking to set up a Lavalink server?**
It's pretty simple to do so, and I'll show you here.

**Setup**
Download the latest `Lavalink.jar` from <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases> here and place an `application.yml` file in the same directory. The file should look like <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example> this.

**Starting it**
Cd into your lavalink directory: e.g `cd <directory>`
Run `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
Check that it started successfully.
*You preferably, should use a process manager for this in the future*

**Using it!**
See `?tag lavalink.py` for more information on Lavalink.py, `?tag pylava` for info on the Pylava library, or `?tag waterlink` for more info on the Waterlink library.

Marvin#9972: ?tag instance
R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

LittleEndu#0001: ?tag typehint
R. Danny#6348: An example of what a type hint is:

```py
async def command(ctx, member: discord.Member):
```

In discord.py, this will attempt to convert your variable to the type that you are specifcying. In this example, it will attempt to convert the string from the message to a `Member`. For example:

```
!command @R. Danny#6348 
# or
!command 80528701850124288
# or
!command "R. Danny"
# This will end up making the member variable declared in the command a `Member` object
```

In normal python, this does not do anything except for documentation purposes. It allows interpretation of the methods, in order to know what type a variable in the parameters is meant to be. IE an IDE is able to tell you you're passing the wrong variable type, based on this.

randomSphere#4274: ?tag greedy
R. Danny#6348: A special converter that greedily consumes arguments until it can’t. As a consequence of this behaviour, most input errors are silently discarded, since it is used as an indicator of when to stop parsing.
When a parser error is met the greedy converter stops converting, undoes the internal string parsing routine, and continues parsing regularly.
For example, in the following code:
```py
@commands.command()
async def test(ctx, numbers: Greedy[int], reason: str):
    await ctx.send("numbers: {}, reason: {}".format(numbers, reason))
```
An invocation of `[p]test 1 2 3 4 5 6 hello` would pass numbers with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and reason with `hello`.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag reboot
R. Danny#6348: The only good way to restart your bot is to shut it down and have your process manager handle it. You can shutdown your bot by running `Bot.close()`.

Do use:
* run your bot in a process manager such as:
  - systemd
  - openrc (gentoo, devuan)
  - runit (void linux)
  - supervisord
  - upstart (old ubuntu)
  - docker
* manually reboot it 

Do not use:
  - a bash loop (it can eat your C-c by rapidly spawning python and if your bot fails it won't stop it from constantly failing)
  - subprocess.call (you will eat your memory up by not letting your old processes die)
  - os.exec*

Nomad#2440: ?tag api abuse
R. Danny#6348: Discord has a very loose interpretation of API abuse; as quoted by them:

```
American Jake01/21/2018
@Danny automating the API in that way /is/ abuse. Automatically doing "X" every N is generally not a good idea. Where X could be posting a message, changing someone's nickname, renaming a role, changing a channel topic, etc... 

Generally bots should only react to user actions... 

Although, for very large N we generally don't care. But for small N, we do care. Think rainbow bots, etc....
```

"N" is not really defined, as rate limits are not a good thing to try to get very close to. You're going to have to mostly use common sense here, compare how close you are the rate limit, how often you do this, etc.

R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

empty embed
lee#3386: ?tag json
R. Danny#6348: JSON is **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation, a serialization format for data.
Advantages of JSON are:
- It is a common data exchange format and has been around for a long time, so many languages will support JSON either in their standard library or with minimal dependencies.
- It provides a common format that can be used to shift data between languages, programs or machines.
- It has a lightweight syntax so minimal space is wasted.
- The syntax can be pretty printed to be made more human-readable.

Disadvantages of JSON are:
- Some languages do not have direct parallels to JSON objects, making them difficult to manage in said languages.
- There may be considerable processing overhead serializing and deserializing to/from JSON.

1) The converters (the type hints) won't be triggered. You need to pass the correct types into the arguments.
2) Checks will be bypassed. You could invoke an owner only command with a non owner and it would still work.
If you still want to run all the checks, see `?rtfm Command.can_run`, which will run all the checks and raise an error if any checks fail.

Xithrius#1318: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

R. Danny#6348: To shard your bot:
```bot = commands.AutoShardedBot(
    command_prefix="?",
    description="An AutoShardedBot.")```

__Sharding__
Sharding is a nice way to split your bot to smaller, more manageable parts. It is recommended to only use this feature with big bots (1000 guilds or more).

R. Danny#6348: Did you mean `aiohttp`?
Sebastiano#5005: ?tag aiohttp
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

Evandar#2379: ?tag message ==
R. Danny#6348: `discord.Message` doesn't implement `==`, so `message1 == message2` is not possible.

You should probably compare ids (`message1.id == message2.id`).

This is a hotly debated issue which is why `==` hasn't be added to messages yet. (See Issue #772)

R. Danny#6348: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/issues/772
StarrFox#6312: ?tag get none
R. Danny#6348: `get_x` and `utils.get` both return `None` if they can't find anything matching. 
Common causes include:
• Wrong key
    ◦ Remember, IDs are ints, not strings
    ◦ If you're trying to copy an emoji ID, right-clicking the emoji in a message will copy message ID
• Bot not logged in, and trying to grab objects from cache
    ◦ Subvairant, using two client objects. See:`?tag botclient`
• Bot cannot "see" the object. 
    ◦ It has to be on the server, share a server with the member, etc
    ◦ If you're sharded on separate processes, each process will only have objects for that shard. 
• Objects retuned by `fetch_x` will not have a populated cache.

R. Danny#6348: jishaku is a debugging and experimenting cog for Discord bots using discord.py@rewrite.
Note that this only works with Python 3.6+ and discord.py rewrite.
You can install it by running the following:
```
pip install -U jishaku
```or
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku
```
To get the cog running, simply do
```
bot.load_extension('jishaku')
```
You can see the source code yourself here: <https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku>

Zomatree#7757: ?tag module not found
R. Danny#6348: **Getting `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'discord'` but you've installed discord.py?**

Chances are that you've installed to a *different python environment* than you are running your bot from. Depending upon the `python` and `pip` commands you use, they may be referring to differing python installs/versions.

Here are some things to try:
▫  Install discord.py with `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py` and run your bot with `python3 yourbot.py`, replacing python3 in both examples with whatever python executable you'd like (on windows, replace `python3` with `py -3`; if you have multiple versions of python 3, be more specific ex. `python3.7` on mac/linux)
▫  Don't attempt to run your bot from within your IDE (run as shown above instead), or if you'd really like to, read its documentation to learn how to configure it for the version of python that discord.py is installed to
▫  Using pycharm? See `?tag pycharm` for information about that.
▫  Consider venv, virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper, or similar to have more control over your python versions and installed modules

MrSnek#3442: ?tag pycharm
R. Danny#6348: If PyCharm is not recognizing your installed packages, chances are it has created a venv¹ for you.

To use the system Python version:
  • Open PyCharm settings (ctrl + alt + s)
  • Choose `Project: <project name>`
  • Choose `Project Interpreter`

At the top there is a drop-down menu for different Python versions.
Choose the correct Python version. Common paths include:
```
C:\PythonXY
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXY
```

If this menu does not list your system Python installation, click the cog to the right of it, and click `add`.
Choose the `System Interpreter` option. If your Python installation is not in this drop-down either, you will manually have to find its installation location and add it there.
After adding your System interpreter follow the steps above to choose it as your project interpreter.

R. Danny#6348: **disclaimer: this works on dark theme only and is not truly transparent**

For an embed to be transparent, like https://i.imgur.com/iEvHd92.png, the embed's colour needs to be set to one of these things:
```py
colour = 0x36393E
colour = 3553598
colour = discord.Colour.from_rgb(54, 57, 62)
discord.Embed(colour=colour)

pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku
```
To get the cog running, simply do
```
bot.load_extension('jishaku')
```
You can see the source code yourself here: <https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku>

Skorpa#5632: ?tag pycharm
R. Danny#6348: If PyCharm is not recognizing your installed packages, chances are it has created a venv¹ for you.

To use the system Python version:
  • Open PyCharm settings (ctrl + alt + s)
  • Choose `Project: <project name>`
  • Choose `Project Interpreter`

At the top there is a drop-down menu for different Python versions.
Choose the correct Python version. Common paths include:
```
C:\PythonXY
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXY
```

If this menu does not list your system Python installation, click the cog to the right of it, and click `add`.
Choose the `System Interpreter` option. If your Python installation is not in this drop-down either, you will manually have to find its installation location and add it there.
After adding your System interpreter follow the steps above to choose it as your project interpreter.

NercoLive#0634: ?tag reddit
R. Danny#6348: Reddit has a read-only API suitable for... reading. If you need to post, praw is great, but for just reading, it's best to use the simple JSON api.

Usage: GET request of `https://www.reddit.com/anything.json`
Example: `https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/hot.json`

Works for users, subreddits, etc.

You should fetch this information with aiohttp- see `?tag aiohttp`
NercoLive#0634: ?tag aiohttp
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

lambda#0987: > all recursive algorithms can be written iteratively
technically this isn't true, there are a few functions which absolutely cannot be de-recursed, like the Ackermann function, but most that you actually encounter can be written iteratively

Dutchy#6127: for config
StarrFox#6312: json is fine for some things
Dutchy#6127: like a config file
clam#5985: i use yml for config
Dutchy#6127: But that you open on start and store in a botvar
Dutchy#6127: so its cached

Charles#5244: <a:Smooth_Loading:470313388782911489> | Hacking clam's IP-Address...
StarrFox#6312: ini is the alpha config file type
clam#5985: lol that's pretty clever ngl
lambda#0987: no rdanny uses it for prefix config as well
lambda#0987: because prefix is checked on message so it needs to be fast
clam#5985: lmaoo
lambda#0987: but you could just as well cache the Postgres response and manage that cache
clam#5985: wait so I should use json for prefixes?
Dutchy#6127: > no rdanny uses it for prefix config as well
But he also caches it. that's the most important part when using json dor storing things <:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
clam#5985: or no
lambda#0987: it's "cached"
clam#5985: assuming no based on the reaction
lambda#0987: same as any json DB
IAmTomahawkx#1000: Just don't be making a dB call, or a file open every message
StarrFox#6312: just make db calls to get prefix
lambda#0987: EC runs two queries on message delete <:rooDab:596576823949918228>

IAmTomahawkx#1000: ?tag db
R. Danny#6348: Want to store your data? Here are some ways:
Format: `**DB** -- python libraries to interface with it`

**PostgreSQL** -- `asyncpg` (good for general use)
**MySQL** -- `aiomysql`

ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag mentions
R. Danny#6348: **Mentions And You**
Mentions are represented in an internal format that looks like this:
`<@​​​80528701850124288>`
`<#​​81402706320699392>`
The syntax tells Discord what type of mention it is, and the numbers are the ID of the mentioned object - e.g. for user mentions it's the user's ID, and for channel mentions it's the channel ID.

They may also contain other characters to signify a role or nickname mention.
Nickname: `<@​​!80528701850124288>`
Role: `<@​&224204725199831040>`

Note that all objects implement `.mention`, so you can just do `object.mention`. Example:
`channel = bot.get_channel('ID')`
`await bot.send_message(channel, channel.mention)`

__Regexes__
User: `r'<@!?(\d+)>'`
Role: `r'<@&(\d+)>'`
Channel: `r'<#(\d+)>'`

*Side-note: `@​everyone`*
`@​everyone` and `@​here` are not represented in this format, instead they
are simply as they appear; just write `@​everyone` or `@​here`

Cy#2501: ?tag blocking
R. Danny#6348: **Using blocking code in your bot?**
Code that is computationally intensive or slow such as PIL, blocks the entire event loop, meaning that your bot cannot process other events, such as messages, during the time that the blocking code is running. If you want to run synchronous code asynchronously, you will need to do it in another thread. Using `await loop.run_in_executor(None, sync_func, *args)` does this for you.

LyricLy#5695: ?tag greedy
R. Danny#6348: A special converter that greedily consumes arguments until it can’t. As a consequence of this behaviour, most input errors are silently discarded, since it is used as an indicator of when to stop parsing.
When a parser error is met the greedy converter stops converting, undoes the internal string parsing routine, and continues parsing regularly.
For example, in the following code:
```py
@commands.command()
async def test(ctx, numbers: Greedy[int], reason: str):
    await ctx.send("numbers: {}, reason: {}".format(numbers, reason))
```
An invocation of `[p]test 1 2 3 4 5 6 hello` would pass numbers with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and reason with `hello`.

R. Danny#6348: **DO NOT HAVE AN OPEN EVAL**
If you do want to create an eval command, make sure only **you** can use it. No one else. Ever.
It can be used to display your bot's token, close your bot, wipe all your bot files, and more.
An example is R. Danny's - <https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny/blob/rewrite/cogs/admin.py#L216-L261>
Don't just copy it, though. Understand what each part and section does before using it.

『Mugiman』#3310: ?tag database
R. Danny#6348: <https://www.postgresql.org/> - Widely used, open source database with good data integrity and feature set. The typical recommendation for bots.
<https://www.mysql.com/> - The de facto SQL standard in software development. Usually not recommended here due to the decreased feature set in comparison to PostgreSQL, but strongly time-tested.
<https://www.sqlite.org/index.html> - File-based DB, no authentication. Lack of networking means query-by-query time is relatively fast, but tends to chug past a certain amount of load.
MrRandom#9258: i think its stigma

R. Danny#6348: jishaku is a debugging and experimenting cog for Discord bots using discord.py@rewrite.
Note that this only works with Python 3.6+ and discord.py rewrite.
You can install it by running the following:
```
pip install -U jishaku
```or
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku
```
To get the cog running, simply do
```
bot.load_extension('jishaku')
```
You can see the source code yourself here: <https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku>

Connor#8645: ?tag edit "eating errors" If you are debugging a command and it is not doing anything or stops at a point without printing any errors in your console, chances are something is erroring and that error is being silently ignored. Make sure there are no try/except blocks that could be ignoring errors and if you have an error handler, you do print exceptions(see `?tag eh` for a proper example).

If you manage to get an error to print and don't know what to do to fix it, you may request for help as long as it's not a SyntaxError and discord.py related. Good luck!

Jacksky#6848: ?tag requests
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

A Discord User#5290: capncord
twitch 🔋#7443: No thanks
zLisandro#0001: ?tag reaction
R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

Xua#1137: if you want to get millions of people off of this garbage platform you need to create a platform that rivals discord with equal advertising prowess
nx#1674: that's hard to do though
StarrFox#6312: I never use embeds so doesnt affect me
ShadowHanzo#2108: and most important
nx#1674: most people are happy w/ discord
A Discord User#5290: the fellow kids shit annoys me

ShadowHanzo#2108: it needs to be free like dc
Xua#1137: and with a small group of 10, 16 ish year old people its not easy
A Discord User#5290: that they use in their advertising
A Discord User#5290: i cannot stand the message spacing
Xua#1137: thats why theres no better platform
Xua#1137: because theres nobody capable of doing it
A Discord User#5290: what happened to the lines after each message

Xua#1137: streaming is perfect as well
A Discord User#5290: it sucks knowing that they'll continue to fuck up their ui and their clients even more than they already have
ShadowHanzo#2108: streaming on *nix
ShadowHanzo#2108: lmao
LyricLy#5695: remember the original Discord UI
Equity#3464: i had to use only one voice channel (alsa) for a workaround and its not that great sometimes

ShadowHanzo#2108: https://i.imgur.com/4m37r8Q.png

Equity#3464: what are they gonna do about it
DuckMasterAl#0001: ?rtfm guild.ban
R. Danny#6348: 
nx#1674: i use it & regret it
A Discord User#5290: thought they would remove 2fa
Xua#1137: i use authy now and its much better but they dont have a client for linux
nx#1674: and then they have login with mobile which is a mess
LyricLy#5695: nope they don't remove 2fa
LyricLy#5695: I very nearly lost this account recently
Xua#1137: yea they wont, ive emailed them before
A Discord User#5290: i should probably remove mfa from my account then
A Discord User#5290: currently using google auth
LyricLy#5695: scraped it back because I was still logged in on Windows
Griffin#5250: <:blobpeek:618588022027321373>

Griffin#5250: Why the ping <@122137595214954498>
nx#1674: check mentions i guess?
A Discord User#5290: i only use mfa because you need them for teams
LyricLy#5695: you might have to reveal blocked messages to comprehend
Griffin#5250: It’s just an L
Griffin#5250: And I’m on mobile so context view isn’t great
nx#1674: > you might have to reveal blocked messages to comprehend
Griffin#5250: Oh, lyric
Equity#3464: btw Griffin i rlly appreciate the pdf u sent me
Griffin#5250: I thought you decided to leave the server
LyricLy#5695: I did
LyricLy#5695: I'm back
Griffin#5250: No you’re not
LyricLy#5695: is that so
LyricLy#5695: then how am I here
SebbyLaw#2597: uh oh
SebbyLaw#2597: I use google auth for like 20 things
LyricLy#5695: fix it quick
Xua#1137: mistake
A Discord User#5290: google auth is shit
nx#1674: bad idea
LyricLy#5695: if you lose your phone you're fucked
LyricLy#5695: switch to authy
nx#1674: authy is 10x better
Griffin#5250: Also the reason I reported lyric is cause he spammed my DMs with a selfbot
SebbyLaw#2597: aight now I know what I'm doing tonight
A Discord User#5290: i'm going to eventually lose my phone or delete the app
nx#1674: then block ?
LyricLy#5695: to be more fair to Griffin, I also reported him
LyricLy#5695: but this goes back longer than that
Griffin#5250: Literally did a `while true: await ctx.send(“hello”)`
Xua#1137: that is a legitimate reason to report tho
LyricLy#5695: that is correct, that is what I wrote
nx#1674: imo just sounds petty
LyricLy#5695: or was it `say`? no, I think it was rewrite period by then
Griffin#5250: His report of me was for... nothing? Trying to have revenge?
Cy#2501: Wat abt github 2fa
Griffin#5250: Idk
Cy#2501: <:thrinking:597590667669274651>
Equity#3464: hey could yall take this to dms
LyricLy#5695: I don't remember but I know I was trying to bait you into selfbotting as well
LyricLy#5695: my plan was poorly thought out
Cy#2501: Dm dont exist
LyricLy#5695: we can't DM each other
Xua#1137: theres nothing wrong with chatting here either
Griffin#5250: Anyways, I’m gonna go back to watching the new r6 operator gameplay
LyricLy#5695: have a nice day
Griffin#5250: Since that’s much more interesting
twitch 🔋#7443: Koolaid man in r6
LyricLy#5695: I'm forced to agree that it is more interesting
Griffin#5250: The frii drones are more interesting
LyricLy#5695: yes I get the point
Equity#3464: yea but some don't care about the ordeal
Xua#1137: some also dont care when we are talking
Griffin#5250: “Some”? I think you mean “you”
LyricLy#5695: does that matter? not like everyone has to care
LyricLy#5695: this is <#381963689470984203>
Xua#1137: i dont care either but im not gonna take away your freedom
LyricLy#5695: we didn't even use up a chat channel

Griffin#5250: Onion got some time too
LyricLy#5695: you appealed and got rebanned immediately?
LyricLy#5695: wait, what happened to onion?!
Griffin#5250: I was there for like 2 months
Griffin#5250: Then pb got tired of me and banned me
Griffin#5250: Onion was banned before either one of us
Griffin#5250: Then unbanned
LyricLy#5695: I guess it's not possible to come back from a unanimous vote after all
Griffin#5250: Then banned again
Cy#2501: ?info Danny

`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

nx#1674: ?tag blocking
R. Danny#6348: **Using blocking code in your bot?**
Code that is computationally intensive or slow such as PIL, blocks the entire event loop, meaning that your bot cannot process other events, such as messages, during the time that the blocking code is running. If you want to run synchronous code asynchronously, you will need to do it in another thread. Using `await loop.run_in_executor(None, sync_func, *args)` does this for you.
A Discord User#5290: this is pretty bad https://hastebin.com/lapotasaci.rb

Lida#6399: ?tag heroku-storedata
R. Danny#6348: Store data in files and host in heroku! It *defenitely* works!
Sebastiano#5005: ?tag noheroku
R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.
Sebastiano#5005: ?tag repl
R. Danny#6348: `repl.it` is just as worse, if not even worse than Heroku for hosting Discord bots.

**Why?**
To get your bot running 24/7, you need to run a webserver with your bot, which is a trivial task. Sure, you can pull it off, but why not use a cheap VPS instead? (`?tag vps`)
Repl.it also has some of the major disadvantages of Heroku (`?tag noheroku`)
Overall, it is a bad platform to host, and you should stay away from it.
Sebastiano#5005: ?tag info noheroku
R. Danny#6348: 
Sebastiano#5005: ?tag vps
R. Danny#6348: Need to run your bot 24/7? Get a cheap VPS.

<https://www.scaleway.com/>- Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by <https://online.net/>, based in Europe.
<https://www.digitalocean.com/> - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide.
<https://www.ovh.co.uk/> - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available.
<https://www.time4vps.eu/> - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania.
<https://www.linode.com/> - More cheap VPSes!
<https://www.vultr.com/> - US-based, DigitalOcean-like.
<https://galaxygate.net/> - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people.

Self-hosting:
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.

Free hosting:
No.  There is no good free VPS hoster, outside of persuading somebody to host for you, which is incredibly unlikely.

Soheab_#5757: ?tag tutorials
R. Danny#6348: Tutorials are fundamentally flawed in concept when it comes to teaching you something like a programming language. The simple reason for this is a programming language is how you create whatever you want, a tutorial is something that teaches you how to do *what the tutorial is teaching*. 
**I recommend reading through all of these points if you want to understand why**
A couple of points against tutorials...especially video tutorials: 

- Tutorials teach you how to create a project, a specific program, a specific script, etc. This causes many many people to only know how to do *this one specific thing*. 

- A programming language is an entire language itself, this is obvious in of itself but for this point think of this compared to a real language...people have accents, there's multiple ways to say the same thing, there's multiple pronunciations for some words. This same kind of concept applies to programming languages, there are many ways to achieve the same thing, there are code styles which people pick up from learning. Sometimes...these practices *can be bad* and if you're just learning, how would you know if the tutorial is using some bad practice? Trust me...this happens **a lot** 

- Tutorials are made for that specific version of whatever it's using...whether this be python, the discord.py library, some other library it's using...etc. As time goes on that can *very quickly* become outdated

- Sometimes there are "advanced" or hard concepts that are covered in a tutorial, you're not guaranteed to understand all of it right off the bat. It is *extremely* hard to provide the relevant documentation for every single concept covered....there would be so much. 

- Specifically for this library, the people who look for *tutorials* are typically new to the language...this library is *not* meant for beginners, there are some advanced concepts (EG asyncio) that are covered, and jumping straight into that as a beginner is very bad.

lee#3386: ?tag type hint
R. Danny#6348: An example of what a type hint is:

```py
async def command(ctx, member: discord.Member):
```

In discord.py, this will attempt to convert your variable to the type that you are specifcying. In this example, it will attempt to convert the string from the message to a `Member`. For example:

```
!command @R. Danny#6348 
# or
!command 80528701850124288
# or
!command "R. Danny"
# This will end up making the member variable declared in the command a `Member` object
```

In normal python, this does not do anything except for documentation purposes. It allows interpretation of the methods, in order to know what type a variable in the parameters is meant to be. IE an IDE is able to tell you you're passing the wrong variable type, based on this.

Revan#0640: ?tag noheroku
R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.
Revan#0640: ?tag vps
R. Danny#6348: Need to run your bot 24/7? Get a cheap VPS.

<https://www.scaleway.com/>- Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by <https://online.net/>, based in Europe.
<https://www.digitalocean.com/> - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide.
<https://www.ovh.co.uk/> - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available.
<https://www.time4vps.eu/> - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania.
<https://www.linode.com/> - More cheap VPSes!
<https://www.vultr.com/> - US-based, DigitalOcean-like.
<https://galaxygate.net/> - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people.

Self-hosting:
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.

Free hosting:
No.  There is no good free VPS hoster, outside of persuading somebody to host for you, which is incredibly unlikely.

R. Danny#6348: **Task is not working, but no errors**
This is because tasks don't raise errors normally. You need to actually pick up the error when the task has completed.

With `discord.ext.tasks`, you can easily use the following:
```python
@your_task.after_loop
async def post_loop(self):
  if self.your_task.failed():
    import traceback
    error = self.your_task.exception()
    traceback.print_exception(type(error), error, error.__traceback__)

R. Danny#6348: You can find almost anyone's email address by finding the email they used in git.

For GitHub, find a commit and add .patch at the end of the commit hash. It should show their name and email address.

If you would not like this to show up, turn on the `Keep Email Address Private` feature located under GitHub Settings > Emails. You should also enable `Block command line pushes that expose my email` just in case you accidentally commit with the wrong email address. Then, go to your repo and run `git config user.email "email provided by github"` in the terminal. You must do this step so you commit with the one GitHub provides you.

If you would like to globally set your email address, add the `--global` flag after `git config`.

LittleEndu#0001: ?tag greedy
R. Danny#6348: A special converter that greedily consumes arguments until it can’t. As a consequence of this behaviour, most input errors are silently discarded, since it is used as an indicator of when to stop parsing.
When a parser error is met the greedy converter stops converting, undoes the internal string parsing routine, and continues parsing regularly.
For example, in the following code:
```py
@commands.command()
async def test(ctx, numbers: Greedy[int], reason: str):
    await ctx.send("numbers: {}, reason: {}".format(numbers, reason))
```
An invocation of `[p]test 1 2 3 4 5 6 hello` would pass numbers with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and reason with `hello`.

R. Danny#6348: **Task is not working, but no errors**
This is because tasks don't raise errors normally. You need to actually pick up the error when the task has completed.

With `discord.ext.tasks`, you can easily use the following:
```python
@your_task.after_loop
async def post_loop(self):
  if self.your_task.failed():
    import traceback
    error = self.your_task.exception()
    traceback.print_exception(type(error), error, error.__traceback__)

R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

DepressedGiraffe#9265: but its new
peanut#0173: wha
Sebastiano#5005: ?tag aiohttp
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict

『Mugiman』#3310: ?tag reboot
R. Danny#6348: The only good way to restart your bot is to shut it down and have your process manager handle it. You can shutdown your bot by running `Bot.close()`.

Do use:
* run your bot in a process manager such as:
  - systemd
  - openrc (gentoo, devuan)
  - runit (void linux)
  - supervisord
  - upstart (old ubuntu)
  - docker
* manually reboot it 

Do not use:
  - a bash loop (it can eat your C-c by rapidly spawning python and if your bot fails it won't stop it from constantly failing)
  - subprocess.call (you will eat your memory up by not letting your old processes die)
  - os.exec*

Strike him down now
A chance at a new start
There's no time for indecision

A river in a dry land
The last ace in a lost hand
When the hope of new beginnings burned our feet
Now we need it:
A heartbeat for a tin man
An oasis in a singed land
Remind us what we're here for:
Creating new life
Creating rivers in the desert

Dutchy#6127: thats all
StarrFox#6312: that isnt subclassing

Lorenzo#6154: because this isn't subclassing

Emote Collector#3350: <:bigbrain:573326997451833344>
Lorenzo#6154: but only if you need to seed
Dutchy#6127: its like subclassing.random.Random is the class
Lorenzo#6154: this is not subclassing
StarrFox#6312: that is nothing like subclassing
Lorenzo#6154: this is creating instantiating an object

system👌ctl#6969: ?tag token leak
R. Danny#6348: ***Oh shit, you leaked your token!***

In some way or another, you have just given your token away. This is not a good thing, as it gives anyone access to the user for that token! You can reset your token in a couple of ways:
**For bot accounts:** Go to your app page <https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/> and generate a new token there.
(Under the `bot` tab for your application)

**For user accounts:** Either change your password, or enable/disable 2fa. Either one will change your user token.
Gadget#0975: ?tag tutorials
R. Danny#6348: Tutorials are fundamentally flawed in concept when it comes to teaching you something like a programming language. The simple reason for this is a programming language is how you create whatever you want, a tutorial is something that teaches you how to do *what the tutorial is teaching*. 
**I recommend reading through all of these points if you want to understand why**
A couple of points against tutorials...especially video tutorials: 

- Tutorials teach you how to create a project, a specific program, a specific script, etc. This causes many many people to only know how to do *this one specific thing*. 

- A programming language is an entire language itself, this is obvious in of itself but for this point think of this compared to a real language...people have accents, there's multiple ways to say the same thing, there's multiple pronunciations for some words. This same kind of concept applies to programming languages, there are many ways to achieve the same thing, there are code styles which people pick up from learning. Sometimes...these practices *can be bad* and if you're just learning, how would you know if the tutorial is using some bad practice? Trust me...this happens **a lot** 

- Tutorials are made for that specific version of whatever it's using...whether this be python, the discord.py library, some other library it's using...etc. As time goes on that can *very quickly* become outdated

- Sometimes there are "advanced" or hard concepts that are covered in a tutorial, you're not guaranteed to understand all of it right off the bat. It is *extremely* hard to provide the relevant documentation for every single concept covered....there would be so much. 

- Specifically for this library, the people who look for *tutorials* are typically new to the language...this library is *not* meant for beginners, there are some advanced concepts (EG asyncio) that are covered, and jumping straight into that as a beginner is very bad.

Lgan#0001: ?tag botvar
R. Danny#6348: Need to keep track of a variable between commands? No problem!

Just add it to your commands.Bot or discord.Client instance like so:

eg
```py
bot = commands.Bot(...)
bot.message_counter = 0

@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    bot.message_counter += 1

@bot.command()
async def counter(ctx):
    await ctx.send("I've seen {} messages so far!".format(ctx.bot.message_counter))
```

This also allows you to access this from other cogs/extensions/functions. Anywhere you have access to the bot instance

R. Danny#6348: First, realize you need to have python 3.5.3+ installed. Whatever version you want to use for your bot, that is the version you want to install discord.py to. Depending on how you installed python, and how many versions you have on your system, there are a few ways you can typically invoke python via cmd (Windows) or via a terminal. The most typical ways are:

**Windows:**
`python`
`py -3`
`py -3.7` (or .6/.5, depending on which version you want)

**Not windows:**
`python`
`python3`
`python3.7` (or .6/.5 depending on which version you want)

Try some of these depending on your system, and append ` -V` to the command, until you find the version that matches the one you are trying to use. Once you have that, you can then replace `python` in the following command, to ensure that you are installing discord.py to your preferred version of python:

```
# without voice
python -m pip install -U discord.py
# with voice
python -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
```

R. Danny#6348: Reddit has a read-only API suitable for... reading. If you need to post, praw is great, but for just reading, it's best to use the simple JSON api.

Usage: GET request of `https://www.reddit.com/anything.json`
Example: `https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/hot.json`

Works for users, subreddits, etc.

You should fetch this information with aiohttp- see `?tag aiohttp`

R. Danny#6348: Platypus is an extension of the discord.ext.commands module that adds additional quality of life features, includng:

- A better default help command
- Better default error handling
- More built-in checks and converters (upcoming)
- Additional usage statistics (upcoming)
- Bot state reflected though status indicator (upcoming)

Platypus's GitHub is at https://github.com/LyricLy/Platypus, so to suggest new features, tell me how much I suck for even coming up with this idea, or PR your own code, go there.

To use Platypus, do pip install platypus-discord and then import platypus in your code. To start with, try using help on the module. Platypus doesn't have proper documentation or docstrings yet; this is coming soon.

Overriding the default provided on_message forbids any extra commands from running. To fix this, add a bot.process_commands(message) line at the end of your on_message. For example:

```@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    # do some extra stuff here

    await bot.process_commands(message)```

R. Danny#6348: jishaku is a debugging and experimenting cog for Discord bots using discord.py@rewrite.
Note that this only works with Python 3.6+ and discord.py rewrite.
You can install it by running the following:
```
pip install -U jishaku
```or
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku
```
To get the cog running, simply do
```
bot.load_extension('jishaku')
```
You can see the source code yourself here: <https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku>

`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])

cutesytootsie#9052: ?tag noheroku
R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

R. Danny#6348: **A simple guide to getting help**

In order for us to help, we need relevant information.

Have an error/issues? **Provide the full traceback output. Show code around the error, and any relevant code.**
Something happening different than expected? **Explain what's expected, then compare to what is actually happening.**

Keep in mind that we are not you, we cannot read your mind, and saying something like "My code doesn't work!" or "I have an error." or "This code is broken, why?" or "Can somebody help me?" gives absolutely nothing, and is just annoying. You must provide information that we need in order to look into whatever your question is.

As a courtesy to others, please refrain from pasting large codeblocks into chat. If it's big enough, you will annoy other users in the channel. Please use services such as <https://hastebin.com>, <https://gist.github.com> or <https://ghostbin.com>.

If you don't know Python, hop into <#381963689470984203> and run `?tag lp`. Without a solid knowledge in Python, we cannot properly assist you. Yes, it will take months. Coding isn't just gluing text together. It takes time and patience — months or years.

    # run_in_executor supports passing args directly, e.g.
    # 'run_in_executor(None, func, one, two, three)' but using
    # partial makes stuff a bit easier to read if you have a

    # a single line.
    some_stuff = await bot.loop.run_in_executor(None, thing)
```
pixaal#1417: ?tag blocking
R. Danny#6348: **Using blocking code in your bot?**
Code that is computationally intensive or slow such as PIL, blocks the entire event loop, meaning that your bot cannot process other events, such as messages, during the time that the blocking code is running. If you want to run synchronous code asynchronously, you will need to do it in another thread. Using `await loop.run_in_executor(None, sync_func, *args)` does this for you.

**Command**:
`python -m pip install discord.py[voice] --upgrade`
**[voice]** = optional, remove that part if you don't use voice related things in your bot.

If that command above didn't work, try `py` instead of `python`

R. Danny#6348: ```py
cmd = bot.get_command("command name")
await cmd(ctx, "positional argument", kwarg='etc')
# or, if you want to use the old way
await ctx.invoke(cmd, "positional argument", kwarg='etc')
```There are 3 downsides to using this method.
1) The converters (the type hints) won't be triggered. You need to pass the correct types into the arguments.
2) Checks will be bypassed. You could invoke an owner only command with a non owner and it would still work.
If you still want to run all the checks, see `?rtfm Command.can_run`, which will run all the checks and raise an error if any checks fail.
3) If ctx.invoke was invoked outside of a command (eg eval), the error handler wont fire.

R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

from discord.ext.commands.cooldowns import BucketType

# Limit how often a command can be used, (num per, seconds, BucketType.default/user/member/guild/channel/role)```
TheFutureKnight#1952: not what I wanted...
TheFutureKnight#1952: ?tag abuse
R. Danny#6348: Discord has a very loose interpretation of API abuse; as quoted by them:

```
American Jake01/21/2018
@Danny automating the API in that way /is/ abuse. Automatically doing "X" every N is generally not a good idea. Where X could be posting a message, changing someone's nickname, renaming a role, changing a channel topic, etc... 

Generally bots should only react to user actions... 

Although, for very large N we generally don't care. But for small N, we do care. Think rainbow bots, etc....
```

"N" is not really defined, as rate limits are not a good thing to try to get very close to. You're going to have to mostly use common sense here, compare how close you are the rate limit, how often you do this, etc.

taaal#6666: ?tag restart
R. Danny#6348: The only good way to restart your bot is to shut it down and have your process manager handle it. You can shutdown your bot by running `Bot.close()`.

Do use:
* run your bot in a process manager such as:
  - systemd
  - openrc (gentoo, devuan)
  - runit (void linux)
  - supervisord
  - upstart (old ubuntu)
  - docker
* manually reboot it 

Do not use:
  - a bash loop (it can eat your C-c by rapidly spawning python and if your bot fails it won't stop it from constantly failing)
  - subprocess.call (you will eat your memory up by not letting your old processes die)
  - os.exec*

DerJonas#8109: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

R. Danny#6348: First create a `.service` file, located in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. You can find a template for it by doing `?tag systemd example` (in <#381963689470984203> of course).
Now assuming the file is named `mybot.service`, run these commands:
- Reload systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
- Start you bot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mybot
```
- If you want it to automatically start on boot:
```bash
systemctl enable mybot
```
And that's basically it. Of course, this tag doesn't cover all what systemd can do. You can get more info by visiting the systemd wiki: <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>

swimmerhair#2017: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

aidzman#2793: ?tag restart
R. Danny#6348: The only good way to restart your bot is to shut it down and have your process manager handle it. You can shutdown your bot by running `Bot.close()`.

Do use:
* run your bot in a process manager such as:
  - systemd
  - openrc (gentoo, devuan)
  - runit (void linux)
  - supervisord
  - upstart (old ubuntu)
  - docker
* manually reboot it 

Do not use:
  - a bash loop (it can eat your C-c by rapidly spawning python and if your bot fails it won't stop it from constantly failing)
  - subprocess.call (you will eat your memory up by not letting your old processes die)
  - os.exec*

R. Danny#6348: 1. Before even attempting to create a discord bot, please **learn python** (`?tag lp`)
2. To install discord.py, please run `python3 -m pip install discord.py` (linux), or `py -3 - m pip install discord.py` (windows)
... a. If you wish to use voice functionality, please use `discord.py[voice]` instead of `discord.py`
3. Take a look at <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/master/examples/basic_bot.py>. Mess around.
4. When you start making your bot, use the **commands ext**: <https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/commands.html>
5. The library documentation is available at <https://discordpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>

**The <#381965515721146390> and <#564950631455129636> channels in this server are related to using *this* library. If you want help with python questions, please ask in the discord.gg/python server.**

If you are migrating from the old version of this library (0.16.XX; async) to  version 1.XX.XX please follow the migrating guide <http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html>

R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

In some way or another, you have just given your token away. This is not a good thing, as it gives anyone access to the user for that token! You can reset your token in a couple of ways:
**For bot accounts**: Go to your app page https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ and generate a new token there.
(Under the `bot` tab for your application)

**For user accounts**: Either change your password, or enable/disable 2fa. Either one will change your user token.

R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

AMereBagatelle#6536: ?tag help
R. Danny#6348: **A simple guide to getting help**

In order for us to help, we need relevant information.

Have an error/issues? **Provide the full traceback output. Show code around the error, and any relevant code.**
Something happening different than expected? **Explain what's expected, then compare to what is actually happening.**

Keep in mind that we are not you, we cannot read your mind, and saying something like "My code doesn't work!" or "I have an error." or "This code is broken, why?" or "Can somebody help me?" gives absolutely nothing, and is just annoying. You must provide information that we need in order to look into whatever your question is.

As a courtesy to others, please refrain from pasting large codeblocks into chat. If it's big enough, you will annoy other users in the channel. Please use services such as <https://hastebin.com>, <https://gist.github.com> or <https://ghostbin.com>.

If you don't know Python, hop into <#381963689470984203> and run `?tag lp`. Without a solid knowledge in Python, we cannot properly assist you. Yes, it will take months. Coding isn't just gluing text together. It takes time and patience — months or years.

R. Danny#6348: Create your own help command by subclassing `HelpCommand` or `MinimalHelpCommand`, then passing it to `bot.help_command`:

```py
class MyHelpCommand(commands.MinimalHelpCommand):
    def get_command_signature(self, command):
        return '{0.clean_prefix}{1.qualified_name} {1.signature}'.format(self, command)

class MyCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):

        bot.help_command.cog = self

    def cog_unload(self):
        self.bot.help_command = self._original_help_command
```
or, you can set the `help_command` kwarg to `None` when instantiating you `commands.Bot` instance, and write your own.

```bot = commands.AutoShardedBot(

__Sharding__
Sharding is a nice way to split your bot to smaller, more manageable parts. It is recommended to only use this feature with big bots (1000 guilds or more).

R. Danny#6348: `get_x` and `utils.get` both return `None` if they can't find anything matching. 
Common causes include:
• Wrong key
    ◦ Remember, IDs are ints, not strings
    ◦ If you're trying to copy an emoji ID, right-clicking the emoji in a message will copy message ID
• Bot not logged in, and trying to grab objects from cache
    ◦ Subvairant, using two client objects. See:`?tag botclient`
• Bot cannot "see" the object. 
    ◦ It has to be on the server, share a server with the member, etc
    ◦ If you're sharded on separate processes, each process will only have objects for that shard. 
• Objects retuned by `fetch_x` will not have a populated cache.

LyricLy#5695: ?tag pi
R. Danny#6348: A raspberry pi is less economic, and less preformant than a cheap VPS? Why?
**Cost:**
pi b3:                   35$
50 gig SD:         10-20$
Power supply:  10$
Other shit:         10$
Total:                   55-70$

Scaleway VPS: 3.50USD/month
OVH VPS:         3.35USD/month

This means that it takes about a year for a PI to have a cheaper base cost.

**Preformance:**
https://i.imgur.com/KEBB9Jo.png

Of importance here is that a raspberry pi has half the ram, and your home internet connection, which, depending on where you are, can range from awful to good. In the end, you're still limited by the fact it has a usb ethernet connection instead of a proper connection. Furthermore, SD cards are slow. That's just the way it is, there isn't a way around it.

R. Danny#6348: To shard your bot:
```bot = commands.AutoShardedBot(
    command_prefix="?",
    description="An AutoShardedBot.")```

__Sharding__
Sharding is a nice way to split your bot to smaller, more manageable parts. It is recommended to only use this feature with big bots (1000 guilds or more).

R. Danny#6348: **Looking to set up a Lavalink server?**
It's pretty simple to do so, and I'll show you here.

**Setup**
Download the latest `Lavalink.jar` from <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases> here and place an `application.yml` file in the same directory. The file should look like <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example> this.

**Starting it**
Cd into your lavalink directory: e.g `cd <directory>`
Run `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
Check that it started successfully.
*You preferably, should use a process manager for this in the future*

**Using it!**
See `?tag lavalink.py` for more information on Lavalink.py, `?tag pylava` for info on the Pylava library, or `?tag waterlink` for more info on the Waterlink library.

R. Danny#6348: \*\*A simple guide to getting help\*\*

In order for us to help, we need relevant information.

Have an error/issues? \*\*Provide the full traceback output. Show code around the error, and any relevant code.\*\*
Something happening different than expected? \*\*Explain what's expected, then compare to what is actually happening.\*\*

Keep in mind that we are not you, we cannot read your mind, and saying something like "My code doesn't work!" or "I have an error." or "This code is broken, why?" or "Can somebody help me?" gives absolutely nothing, and is just annoying. You must provide information that we need in order to look into whatever your question is.

As a courtesy to others, please refrain from pasting large codeblocks into chat. If it's big enough, you will annoy other users in the channel. Please use services such as \<https://hastebin.com>, \<https://gist.github.com> or \<https://ghostbin.com>.

If you don't know Python, hop into \<#381963689470984203\> and run \`?tag lp\`. Without a solid knowledge in Python, we cannot properly assist you. Yes, it will take months. Coding isn't just gluing text together. It takes time and patience — months or years.

devon#4089: ?tag noheroku
R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

```
**--------------------**

If a message is already sent by the bot, you have to fetch it:

```py
message = await channel.fetch_message(id)

# if the message is in the current channel, 
# you can put "ctx.channel" otherwise get the channel:
# channel = ctx.guild.get_channel(channelid) 

# id = the ID of the message you want to edit, get it with dev mode on by right clicking.
```
if you want to get the embed from a message and edit that embed you do:

```py
message.embeds[0]
await message.edit(embed=...)

# message is the fetched message.
```

MrSnek#3442: ?tag get none
R. Danny#6348: `get_x` and `utils.get` both return `None` if they can't find anything matching. 
Common causes include:
• Wrong key
    ◦ Remember, IDs are ints, not strings
    ◦ If you're trying to copy an emoji ID, right-clicking the emoji in a message will copy message ID
• Bot not logged in, and trying to grab objects from cache
    ◦ Subvairant, using two client objects. See:`?tag botclient`
• Bot cannot "see" the object. 
    ◦ It has to be on the server, share a server with the member, etc
    ◦ If you're sharded on separate processes, each process will only have objects for that shard. 
• Objects retuned by `fetch_x` will not have a populated cache.

hamza1311#1371: ?tag botvar
R. Danny#6348: Need to keep track of a variable between commands? No problem!

Just add it to your commands.Bot or discord.Client instance like so:

eg
```py
bot = commands.Bot(...)
bot.message_counter = 0

@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    bot.message_counter += 1

@bot.command()
async def counter(ctx):
    await ctx.send("I've seen {} messages so far!".format(ctx.bot.message_counter))
```

This also allows you to access this from other cogs/extensions/functions. Anywhere you have access to the bot instance
hamza1311#1371: <@!92730223316959232> might wanna edit the tag and put `process_commands` in `on_message`

ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag noheroku
R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag mentions
R. Danny#6348: **Mentions And You**
Mentions are represented in an internal format that looks like this:
`<@​​​80528701850124288>`
`<#​​81402706320699392>`
The syntax tells Discord what type of mention it is, and the numbers are the ID of the mentioned object - e.g. for user mentions it's the user's ID, and for channel mentions it's the channel ID.

They may also contain other characters to signify a role or nickname mention.
Nickname: `<@​​!80528701850124288>`
Role: `<@​&224204725199831040>`

Note that all objects implement `.mention`, so you can just do `object.mention`. Example:
`channel = bot.get_channel('ID')`
`await bot.send_message(channel, channel.mention)`

__Regexes__
User: `r'<@!?(\d+)>'`
Role: `r'<@&(\d+)>'`
Channel: `r'<#(\d+)>'`

*Side-note: `@​everyone`*
`@​everyone` and `@​here` are not represented in this format, instead they
are simply as they appear; just write `@​everyone` or `@​here`

R. Danny#6348: You're using the old, 0.16.x (async branch) version of discord.py, or appear to be trying to use methods from the async branch.
The rewrite branch (1.x.x) of discord.py was pushed to PyPi and made the master branch of discord.py on april 8th. 
**It is a massive breaking change**
Methods such as `client.send_message` now have an entirely different syntax and style.
If you want support here, it is required that you **migrate to the new version of discord.py**. 
See the migrating guide for instructions on how to do so.
<https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html>

The async branch, 0.16.x, is no longer supported here.

R. Danny#6348: If you are looking for saving data then have a look at postgres.
PostgreSQL(<https://www.postgresql.org/>) is one of the best relational databases which is most programmers' first preference. We call it Postgres because why not?
The python driver, asyncpg(<https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/>), provides asynchronous support for Postgres!
If you have prior experience with SQL then you can easily switch to Postgres. If you don't then you can take this interactive tutorial at <https://sqlbolt.com>
Have a look at this Example Code as well to get a quick start: <https://gist.github.com/jegfish/cfc7b22e72426f5ced6f87caa6920fd6>
ViChyavIn#0299: ?tag database
R. Danny#6348: <https://www.postgresql.org/> - Widely used, open source database with good data integrity and feature set. The typical recommendation for bots.
<https://www.mysql.com/> - The de facto SQL standard in software development. Usually not recommended here due to the decreased feature set in comparison to PostgreSQL, but strongly time-tested.
<https://www.sqlite.org/index.html> - File-based DB, no authentication. Lack of networking means query-by-query time is relatively fast, but tends to chug past a certain amount of load.

R. Danny#6348: ```py
async def get_pre(bot, message):
  return "prefix"  # or a list, ["pre1","pre2"]

Mr_ChAI#1824: !tag on_message
R. Danny#6348: Why does `on_message` make my commands stop working?
Overriding the default provided on_message forbids any extra commands from running. To fix this, add a bot.process_commands(message) line at the end of your on_message. For example:

```@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    # do some extra stuff here

    await bot.process_commands(message)```

Gobot1234#2435: ?tag install
R. Danny#6348: First, realize you need to have python 3.5.3+ installed. Whatever version you want to use for your bot, that is the version you want to install discord.py to. Depending on how you installed python, and how many versions you have on your system, there are a few ways you can typically invoke python via cmd (Windows) or via a terminal. The most typical ways are:

**Windows:**
`python`
`py -3`
`py -3.7` (or .6/.5, depending on which version you want)

**Not windows:**
`python`
`python3`
`python3.7` (or .6/.5 depending on which version you want)

Try some of these depending on your system, and append ` -V` to the command, until you find the version that matches the one you are trying to use. Once you have that, you can then replace `python` in the following command, to ensure that you are installing discord.py to your preferred version of python:

```
# without voice
python -m pip install -U discord.py
# with voice
python -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
```

Nitrous#1337: ?tag get message
R. Danny#6348: `bot.get_message` is __not__ a thing btw, use `await channel.fetch_message` :
```py
message = await channel.fetch_message(id)
await ctx.send(message) # this will return a message object, if found, to get the actual content you can put: message.content.
# channel should be a instance of abc.Messageable

# id = the ID of the message you looking for in the given channel.

ShaDii (LoveU☹)#5728: ?tag install
R. Danny#6348: First, realize you need to have python 3.5.3+ installed. Whatever version you want to use for your bot, that is the version you want to install discord.py to. Depending on how you installed python, and how many versions you have on your system, there are a few ways you can typically invoke python via cmd (Windows) or via a terminal. The most typical ways are:

**Windows:**
`python`
`py -3`
`py -3.7` (or .6/.5, depending on which version you want)

**Not windows:**
`python`
`python3`
`python3.7` (or .6/.5 depending on which version you want)

Try some of these depending on your system, and append ` -V` to the command, until you find the version that matches the one you are trying to use. Once you have that, you can then replace `python` in the following command, to ensure that you are installing discord.py to your preferred version of python:

```
# without voice
python -m pip install -U discord.py
# with voice
python -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
```
J_J#2112: <@!475304536920031232> recommend voice if ur installing

good for testing purposes if u selfhost

R. Danny#6348: If you need commands, use the commands extension.
**Docs:** <http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html>

**Why should I use the commands extension?**
 - Prevents spaghetti code
 - Better performance
 - Easy handling and processing of command arguments
 - Argument type converters
 - Easy sub commands
 - Command cooldowns
 - Built-in help function
 - Easy prefix management
 - Command checks, for controlling when they're to be invoked
 - Ability to add command modules via extensions/cogs

Xua#1137: good bot
Xua#1137: its not a mine
Zorkai#9999: D1
MostDefinitelyGrant2#9892: 
Xua#1137: C1 has a 2, and those connect to flags C0 and D2
Xua#1137: so that means every other number around C1 is safe

MostDefinitelyGrant2#9892: 
Xua#1137: if a mine and a number cant overlap, then you cant put a flag on it

IAmTomahawkx#1000: Why are there flags?
Xua#1137: marking a bomb
IAmTomahawkx#1000: No
IAmTomahawkx#1000: At the top

Nerrix#5439: ?tag http
R. Danny#6348: The following are "raw" methods. 
These are all for internal use, and could be subject to change without notification.
Only the methods for `message` are documented, as everything else can be done with proper class methods and possible application of `discord.Object`
Use only if you have to, not suitable for general consumption.

```py
client.http.do_thing

client.http.add_reaction(channel_id, message_id, emoji)
client.http.remove_reaction(channel_id, message_id, emoji, member_id)
client.http.remove_own_reaction(channel_id, message_id, emoji)
client.http.get_reaction_users(channel_id, message_id, emoji, limit, after=None):
client.http.clear_reactions(channel_id, message_id)
client.http.pin_message(channel_id, message_id)
client.http.unpin_message(channel_id, message_id)
client.http.edit_message(channel_id, message_id, **fields) #fields can include content, etc. Embeds must be to_dict'd
client.http.delete_message(channel_id, message_id, *, reason=None)
```
All emojis must be a unicode string or in name:emoji format.

**Alternatively, for an easier method, see `?tag partialmessage`**
Nerrix#5439: ?tag partialmessage
R. Danny#6348: ```py
class RawMessage(discord.Message):
    def __init__(self, bot, channel_id, message_id):
        self._state = bot._connection
        self.id = message_id
        self.channel = bot.get_channel(channel_id)
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'lazy'```
Usage:
```py
message = RawMessage(bot, 258116015534243840,566412287779274754)
await message.delete()```
Note: many attributes and such will not be populated or present, but most methods should work fine.

LittleEndu#0001: ?tag ext.tasks error
R. Danny#6348: **Task is not working, but no errors**
This is because tasks don't raise errors normally. You need to actually pick up the error when the task has completed.

With `discord.ext.tasks`, you can easily use the following:
```python
@your_task.after_loop
async def post_loop(self):
  if self.your_task.failed():
    import traceback
    error = self.your_task.exception()
    traceback.print_exception(type(error), error, error.__traceback__)
```

exiva#7070: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

LyricLy#5695: ?tag restart
R. Danny#6348: The only good way to restart your bot is to shut it down and have your process manager handle it. You can shutdown your bot by running `Bot.close()`.

Do use:
* run your bot in a process manager such as:
  - systemd
  - openrc (gentoo, devuan)
  - runit (void linux)
  - supervisord
  - upstart (old ubuntu)
  - docker
* manually reboot it 

Do not use:
  - a bash loop (it can eat your C-c by rapidly spawning python and if your bot fails it won't stop it from constantly failing)
  - subprocess.call (you will eat your memory up by not letting your old processes die)
  - os.exec*

R. Danny#6348: Made a subtle change and your bot no longer responds to commands?
Are you using an on_message event? Do you have no idea what a discord.py "Cog" is?
**Your beans have been eaten!**
Overriding the stock-standard on_message will stop commands from running. To fix this, add a`` bot.process_commands(message)`` line at the end of your on_message event. For the sake of example (now with syntax highlighting!):
```python
@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    # do some extra stuff here

    await bot.process_commands(message)
```
This should rectify any issues you have with commands disappearing. **Make sure process_commands is the last thing you do if you want things to work as intended!**

Hello,

I'm having a pretty frustrating problem. See, the thing is that I want to reserve Windows 10 to get it when it comes out in July.

But I can't, because my computer has Windows 8.1 Pro, and when you upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro, you get Windows 10 Pro.

However, my product/activation/whatever key for Windows 8.1 Pro is invalid, due to the fact that Windows 8.1 Pro was installed after my computer was wiped after a failure in the installation of Ubuntu Linux.

So, without losing any of my files (Metro apps are okay to lose, I don't mind losing those), I want to downgrade my Windows 8.1 Pro to plain Windows 8.1 without having to buy anything.

So, is it possible? I hope so!
kriX#9879: Hewwo,

But I can't, because my computew has Windows 8.1 Pwo, and when you upgwade fwom Windows 8.1 Pwo, you get Windows 10 Pwo.

Howevew, my pwoduct/activation/whatevew key fow Windows 8.1 Pwo is invawid, due to the fact that Windows 8.1 Pwo was instawwed aftew my computew was wiped aftew a faiwuwe in the instawwation of Ubuntu Winyux.

So, without wosing any of my fiwes (Metwo apps awe okay to wose, I don't mind wosing those), I want to downgwade my Windows 8.1 Pwo to pwain Windows 8.1 without having to buy anything. ;;w;;

In some way or another, you have just given your client secret away. This is not a good thing. Anyone can obtain a bearer token for the bot owner's (your) account using that. More info here: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#client-credentials-grant

You can reset your client secret by going to your app page https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ and generating a new client secret there.

**Docs:** <http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html>

**Why should I use the commands extension?**
 - Prevents spaghetti code
 - Better performance
 - Easy handling and processing of command arguments
 - Argument type converters
 - Easy sub commands
 - Command cooldowns
 - Built-in help function
 - Easy prefix management
 - Command checks, for controlling when they're to be invoked
 - Ability to add command modules via extensions/cogs
 - Still able to do everything you can do with `Client`

zLisandro#0001: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Cyrus#8315: ?tag db
R. Danny#6348: Want to store your data? Here are some ways:
Format: `**DB** -- python libraries to interface with it`

**PostgreSQL** -- `asyncpg` (good for general use)
**MySQL** -- `aiomysql`
**SQLite** -- `aiosqlite` (good if your bot is small and/or private)

Note while JSON *can* be used if it's a small/simple bot, care must be taken in order to avoid losing your data.

R. Danny#6348: If you are looking for saving data then have a look at postgres.
PostgreSQL(<https://www.postgresql.org/>) is one of the best relational databases which is most programmers' first preference. We call it Postgres because why not?
The python driver, asyncpg(<https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/>), provides asynchronous support for Postgres!
If you have prior experience with SQL then you can easily switch to Postgres. If you don't then you can take this interactive tutorial at <https://sqlbolt.com>

Revan#0640: ?tag greedy
R. Danny#6348: A special converter that greedily consumes arguments until it can’t. As a consequence of this behaviour, most input errors are silently discarded, since it is used as an indicator of when to stop parsing.
When a parser error is met the greedy converter stops converting, undoes the internal string parsing routine, and continues parsing regularly.
For example, in the following code:
```py
@commands.command()
async def test(ctx, numbers: Greedy[int], reason: str):
    await ctx.send("numbers: {}, reason: {}".format(numbers, reason))
```
An invocation of `[p]test 1 2 3 4 5 6 hello` would pass numbers with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and reason with `hello`.

R. Danny#6348: **What is a coroutine?**
A coroutine is a function that must be invoked with `await` or `yield from`. When Python encounters an `await` it stops the function’s execution at that point and works on other things until it comes back to that point and finishes off its work. This allows for your program to be doing multiple things at the same time without using threads or complicated multiprocessing.

If you forget to await a coroutine then the coroutine will not run. Never forget to await a coroutine.

**Where can I use await?**
You can only use await inside `async def` functions and nowhere else.

LittleEndu#0001: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

**Why should I use the commands extension?**
 - Prevents spaghetti code
 - Better performance
 - Easy handling and processing of command arguments
 - Argument type converters
 - Easy sub commands
 - Command cooldowns
 - Built-in help function
 - Easy prefix management
 - Command checks, for controlling when they're to be invoked
 - Ability to add command modules via extensions/cogs
 - Still able to do everything you can do with `Client`

<https://www.scaleway.com/>- Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by <https://online.net/>, based in Europe.
<https://www.digitalocean.com/> - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide.
<https://www.ovh.co.uk/> - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available.
<https://www.time4vps.eu/> - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania.
<https://www.linode.com/> - More cheap VPSes!
<https://www.vultr.com/> - US-based, DigitalOcean-like.
<https://galaxygate.net/> - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people.

Self-hosting:
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.

Free hosting:
No.  There is no good free VPS hoster, outside of persuading somebody to host for you, which is incredibly unlikely.
lambda#0987: 
Soheab_#5757: ?tag noheroku
R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

『Mugiman』#3310: ?tag on_message
R. Danny#6348: Why does `on_message` make my commands stop working?
Overriding the default provided on_message forbids any extra commands from running. To fix this, add a bot.process_commands(message) line at the end of your on_message. For example:

```@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    # do some extra stuff here

    await bot.process_commands(message)```

R. Danny#6348: 
Skorpa#5632: ?tag greedy
R. Danny#6348: A special converter that greedily consumes arguments until it can’t. As a consequence of this behaviour, most input errors are silently discarded, since it is used as an indicator of when to stop parsing.
When a parser error is met the greedy converter stops converting, undoes the internal string parsing routine, and continues parsing regularly.
For example, in the following code:
```py
@commands.command()
async def test(ctx, numbers: Greedy[int], reason: str):
    await ctx.send("numbers: {}, reason: {}".format(numbers, reason))
```
An invocation of `[p]test 1 2 3 4 5 6 hello` would pass numbers with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and reason with `hello`.

Skorpa#5632: ?tag reaction
R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

devon#4089: in false case it has the same efficiency as an if statement
devon#4089: in true case it is less efficent because the condition gets checked twice and the iterator is incremented
Equity#3464: rw info
Ava#4982: You don't actually have to increment it
Ava#4982: also a smart compiler will generate the exact same asm for the two
Sebastiano#5005: Credo che toglierò il comando
devon#4089: you don't actually have to increment it
devon#4089: and a smart compiler optimizing code as garbage as this is just a testament to how good compilers are
Ava#4982: You can just do `for (;conditional;)`
devon#4089: i wager a lot probably don't optimize this
Ava#4982: Even the oldest compilers I can find do
Ava#4982: so
Ava#4982: idk
devon#4089: probably a special case
Ava#4982: well not really
Ava#4982: even with adding the initialization and increment the increment always gets optimized out
Ava#4982: and the initialization adds 1 line
Ava#4982: even on Arduino Uno (1.8.9) it is the same
Ava#4982: and AVR gcc 4.5.4
devon#4089: yes but the condition should without optimization be checked twice
devon#4089: the compiler has to identify the conditional is completely static and realize it has no side effects
Ava#4982: even with -O0 that is not the case
Ava#4982: There is only one extra `mov` for the initialization
devon#4089: yes but consider how a typical for loop would be laid out in ASM
Ava#4982: buddy I literally have compiler explorer open
devon#4089: yes i know compilers are great
Ava#4982: And I'm using `-O0`
Ava#4982: which doesn't optimize
devon#4089: in theory
Ava#4982: You only need one `test`
devon#4089: but for a typical for loop you would need to check the condition once to permit flow into the loop (so it is not skipped) and then check again to know not to repeat it
Ava#4982: or whatever the equiv. asm is
devon#4089: it getting optimized out on -O0 is actually even kind of more evidence towards this being a special case
Ava#4982: or `cmp`
Ava#4982: It's probably a special case for `bool`
Ava#4982: yeah it is a special case for bool
Ava#4982: so `a < b` would be optimized but uh
Ava#4982: idk what wouldn't
Ava#4982: You could always just typecast xd
devon#4089: anything that isn't reliably constant
devon#4089: try a function call that reads a memory address or uses a library
Ava#4982: well yeah the whole analogy breaks down if you assume non-boolean return values
Ava#4982: actually no <:rooThink:596576798351949847>

Skorpa#5632: ?tag aiohttp
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>
Ava#4982: so the optimization would always apply
devon#4089: it's more about side effects
Ava#4982: You can go play it with yourself on compiler explorer I gues
devon#4089: without the optimization the condition is supposed to be called twice
devon#4089: because it's checking one to permit flow into the loop and once to escape it
devon#4089: so if you call a function that does something like writing to the screen or whatever and the optimization applies you'll get different effects than intended
Ava#4982: No but that doesn't actually happen
Ava#4982: Because the 2nd argument in the `for` loop is a uh
Ava#4982: I don
Ava#4982: doesn't depend on the for loop body
devon#4089: predicate?
Satoru#6725: 
Soheab_#5757: e?pr
Ava#4982: it only needs to be checked once
Sebastiano#5005: er!stream calcutta
Ava#4982: something that is kind of a constant expression but also is not a constant expression
Satoru Music#5299: 
devon#4089: https://repl.it/repls/SpecificProbableLevel
devon#4089: predicate is checked twice
devon#4089: it needs to be checked twice because the second check is what frees it from the loop
Ava#4982: this uses `i`
Ava#4982: so it's not the same
Ava#4982: remove `i <`
devon#4089: https://canary.discordapp.com/channels/336642139381301249/448285120634421278/680102956518866969
devon#4089: this is what you originally posted and what i've been arguing about
Ava#4982: oh I had `i < `
Ava#4982: for some reason
Ava#4982: I didn't mean to 😢
devon#4089: if i remove `i <` the loop goes on forever
Ava#4982: hmm
devon#4089: because the condition is always true
Ava#4982: yeah because it needs to return false lol
Ava#4982: so it's `int (;!thing;)`
devon#4089: if it returns false the loop never runs and then yes it is as efficient as an if statement
devon#4089: which i mentioned
devon#4089: so it doesn't behave the same as a for loop
Ava#4982: so my original mistake was using `i <` instead of `!`
devon#4089: well no because if you do ! the loop never runs

Ava#4982: oh but yeah when it's true it just runs forever
devon#4089: so it is useless as an "if statement"
Ava#4982: you are right
Ava#4982: I wonder why the hell I got the same assembly then <:rooThink:596576798351949847>
devon#4089: probably because you were doing `i <`
Ava#4982: oh wait
Ava#4982: no
Ava#4982: I know why
devon#4089: which is actually optimizable because past 1 loop `i` is 1 and thus the condition is false no matter what
Ava#4982: It's because my loop body was a `return`
Ava#4982: _that_ is the key part
Ava#4982: <:yert:596577410888105995>
devon#4089: :mfw:
devon#4089: in theory
Ava#4982: This is why you don't code at 11 PM
devon#4089: you could use `break`
Ava#4982: yeah
devon#4089: and have it be "functionally equivalent"
Ava#4982: But yeah when you don't do that it is called many times
devon#4089: since then the condition won't be ran twice either
devon#4089: so it would actually perfectly mirror an if statement by spec

IAmTomahawkx#1000: ?tag noheroku
R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

IAmTomahawkx#1000: ?tag repl.it
Caasi#7762: Lol
R. Danny#6348: `repl.it` is just as worse, if not even worse than Heroku for hosting Discord bots.

**Why?**
To get your bot running 24/7, you need to run a webserver with your bot, which is a trivial task. Sure, you can pull it off, but why not use a cheap VPS instead? (`?tag vps`)
Repl.it also has some of the major disadvantages of Heroku (`?tag noheroku`)
Overall, it is a bad platform to host, and you should stay away from it.

Skorpa#5632: ?tag aiohttp
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])

Painezor#8489: ?tag add_reaction
R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`
Rubix#8166: ?tag emotes
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Lida#6399: ?tag add_reaction
R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`
Soheab_#5757: <@!529535587728752644> that's from on_command

Leon#2018: ?tag custom emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

R. Danny#6348: **Mentions And You**
Mentions are represented in an internal format that looks like this:
`<@​​​80528701850124288>`
`<#​​81402706320699392>`
The syntax tells Discord what type of mention it is, and the numbers are the ID of the mentioned object - e.g. for user mentions it's the user's ID, and for channel mentions it's the channel ID.

They may also contain other characters to signify a role or nickname mention.
Nickname: `<@​​!80528701850124288>`
Role: `<@​&224204725199831040>`

Note that all objects implement `.mention`, so you can just do `object.mention`. Example:
`channel = bot.get_channel('ID')`
`await bot.send_message(channel, channel.mention)`

__Regexes__
User: `r'<@!?(\d+)>'`
Role: `r'<@&(\d+)>'`
Channel: `r'<#(\d+)>'`

*Side-note: `@​everyone`*
`@​everyone` and `@​here` are not represented in this format, instead they
are simply as they appear; just write `@​everyone` or `@​here`

R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Lida#6399: ?tag add_reaction
R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag is or ==
R. Danny#6348: __**Difference between == and is operator in Python**__

The == operator compares the values of both the operands and checks for value equality. Whereas is operator checks whether both the operands refer to the same object or not.

```py
list1 = [] 
list2 = [] 
list3=list1 
  
if list1 == list2: 
    print("True") 
else: 
    print("False") 
  
if list1 is list2: 
    print("True") 
else: 
    print("False") 
  
if list1 is list3: 
    print("True") 
else:     
    print("False") ```
**Output:**
```sh
True
False
True```

>>> -Output of the first if condition is “True” as both list1 and list2 are empty lists.

- Second if condition shows “False” because two empty lists are at different memory locations. Hence list1 and list2 refer to different objects. We can check it with id() function in python which returns the “identity” of an object.

- Output of the third if condition is “True” as both list1 and list3 are pointing to the same object.

R. Danny#6348: .webp is the default file extension of discord images. For example, `guild.icon_url` returns xyz.webp. This is not very good as for some devices, webp images won't load without saving to a file, most notably iPhones and older versions of discord

Some ways to change this are

`x.icon_url_as(...)/x.avatar_url_as()`
Or the 'I'm lazy'/'idk python' way:
`str(x.icon_url).replace('.webp', '.png')/str(x.avatar_url).replace('.webp', '.png')`. This isn't ideal because you know, gifs.

Lida#6399: ?tag webp
R. Danny#6348: .webp is the default file extension of discord images. For example, `guild.icon_url` returns xyz.webp. This is not very good as for some devices, webp images won't load without saving to a file, most notably iPhones and older versions of discord

Some ways to change this are

`x.icon_url_as(...)/x.avatar_url_as()`
Or the 'I'm lazy'/'idk python' way:
`str(x.icon_url).replace('.webp', '.png')/str(x.avatar_url).replace('.webp', '.png')`. This isn't ideal because you know, gifs.

Mugiman#3310: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

SapGro#7205: ?tag traceback
R. Danny#6348: Give me your traceback! It will be easier for the both of us, and will make debugging way easier. 
Please either **use a github gist, or hastebin, or ghostbin.**
If your traceback is small, you can send it on discord with codeblocks (tag codeblocks)
Please **do not send me a screenshot of your traceback.**
Please do not use pastebin.
Please give me all the traceback. Hiding tracebacks ends poorly, and will make life harder for me.

Enis#8165: ?tag aiohttp
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])

(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

Nitrous#1337: ?tag asyncio
R. Danny#6348: The library uses a method of parallelism called 'asynchronous programming'. To do this is uses the module `asyncio`.

Unlike more traditional parallelism techniques, during "wait" periods, like for example during a web request, a special function, known as a coroutine will yield back to the event loop allowing other coroutines to run in it's waiting period.

Functions that do not yield back to the event loop are known as blocking functions. Excessive periods of blocking code can cause havoc, unless planned out thoroughly.
