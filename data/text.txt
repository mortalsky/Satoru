Saksynator#5566: Oh
Fletcha#9630: ?tag emojis
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Lida#6399: ?tag repl.it
R. Danny#6348: `repl.it` is just as worse, if not even worse than Heroku for hosting Discord bots.

**Why?**
To get your bot running 24/7, you need to run a webserver with your bot, which is a trivial task. Sure, you can pull it off, but why not use a cheap VPS instead? (`?tag vps`)
Repl.it also has some of the major disadvantages of Heroku (`?tag noheroku`)
Overall, it is a bad platform to host, and you should stay away from it.
Lida#6399: ?tag vps
R. Danny#6348: Need to run your bot 24/7? Get a cheap VPS.

<https://www.scaleway.com/>- Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by <https://online.net/>, based in Europe.
<https://www.digitalocean.com/> - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide.
<https://www.ovh.co.uk/> - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available.
<https://www.time4vps.eu/> - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania.
<https://www.linode.com/> - More cheap VPSes!
<https://www.vultr.com/> - US-based, DigitalOcean-like.
<https://galaxygate.net/> - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people.

Self-hosting:
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.

Free hosting:
No.  There is no good free VPS hoster, outside of persuading somebody to host for you, which is incredibly unlikely.

R. Danny#6348: Create your own help command by subclassing `HelpCommand` or `MinimalHelpCommand`, then passing it to `bot.help_command`:

```py
class MyHelpCommand(commands.MinimalHelpCommand):
    def get_command_signature(self, command):
        return '{0.clean_prefix}{1.qualified_name} {1.signature}'.format(self, command)

class MyCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self._original_help_command = bot.help_command
        bot.help_command = MyHelpCommand()
        bot.help_command.cog = self

    def cog_unload(self):
        self.bot.help_command = self._original_help_command
```
or, you can set the `help_command` kwarg to `None` when instantiating you `commands.Bot` instance, and write your own.

R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

Ava#4982: sewer main burst does sound bad
I’veGotABlankSpace#8100: <@!319753218592866315> you are the biggest asshole I have ever met. I have done nothing but be nice to you for as long as i've known you. I always stood up for you when people were being dicks to you, I tried to get you unbanned because I liked hanging out with you, I kept messaging you even though you didnt come back because i still wanted to talk to you. 

> don't bring him back
 I fought to get you unbanned, asking multiple times for you to come back, and yet the instant you come back after I get banned, you tell everyone to keep me banned. 

> it shouldn't be on us to keep him not being a dick
You call me a dick yet *YOU HAVENT BEEN IN THE FUCKING SERVER FOR OVER A GOD DAMN YEAR SO HOW THE FUCK WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN LIKE!*

> he stopped responding to my DMs which was sad because I did enjoy hearing him whine about how I have to come back
wow. is that all it was to you? whining? I was trying to be nice to you and stay friends with you, and you call that *whining*?

You know you were the one person who kept me from leaving this server back in 2018 when everyone was being mean to be because i didnt understand something? You were the only one who took the time to slow down and explain to me what I had to do and why I was messing up. That's why I stayed. Because I saw that there was at least one person who was nice and I could trust. If only I had known how wrong I was back then I could've saved the past year and a half of my life.

Dimbreath#0424: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Dutchy#6127: ?tag import
R. Danny#6348: If you need to import a variable from a different python file, it's pretty easy. In your external file, have a variable and set its value (in this example we'll be using a token, and our file name is called `myfile.py`):
```py
token = "blah blah blah" <-- inside of myfile.py
```
Now, in your main file, you can import the file (by name) and get the token by an attribute of the file:
```py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import myfile # <-- import your external file here

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

# code

bot.run(myfile.token)
```
Now, get your ass on some Python learning websites you filthy prick:

Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.

Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.

```There are 3 downsides to using this method.
1) The converters (the type hints) won't be triggered. You need to pass the correct types into the arguments.
2) Checks will be bypassed. You could invoke an owner only command with a non owner and it would still work.
If you still want to run all the checks, see `?rtfm Command.can_run`, which will run all the checks and raise an error if any checks fail.
3) If ctx.invoke was invoked outside of a command (eg eval), the error handler wont fire.

R. Danny#6348: Checks are a way of limiting a command's use in a certain situation.
D.py has a list of inbuilt checks you can find here <https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html#checks>

A check is applied to a command through the use of decorators. These go above or below the command decorator as like in the example bellow. You can have multiple checks for one command.
```py
@bot.command()
@commands.has_role("Cool Dudes")
async def hello():
```
Checks call also be global or cog wide. See `?tag locational checks`
D.py implements a custom check system if the in built checks are insufficient. See `?tag better custom checks toad`

Kaylynn#4444: i'm so goddamn confused
i'm just trying to call a predicate
why are the wrong errors getting raise
Cy#2501: Wat error
Kaylynn#4444: just a base CheckFailure
Kaylynn#4444: when it should be MissingRequiredPermissions or etc
Kaylynn#4444: <cradd

Cy#2501: Is that your custom check
Kaylynn#4444: it's an issue with my custom check yes
Equity#3464: any mongodb users?

MrHouck#6432: yikes
Equity#3464: ok dad so
Kaylynn#4444: but it's not my check that's causing issues
Equity#3464: uh fuck i forgot question
Cy#2501: <:waitwhat:596577409768226816>
Equity#3464: oh yea
Kaylynn#4444: it's uh commands.has_permissions
Kaylynn#4444: i'm trying to call the redicate for it
Equity#3464: since u use motor, how would u detect if the lib is actually connected to mongo
Kaylynn#4444: and i'm getting CheckFailured'd instead of MissingRequiredPermissions'd
Equity#3464: and how does mongo handle stuff when i try to grab shit from nested dicts that may not be nested
Xua#1137: ```py
        try:
            await self.db.abyss.accounts.find_one({})
            self.log.info("MongoDB connection success")
            # dummy query to ensure the db is connected
        except Exception as exc:
            self.log.error("COULD NOT CONNECT TO MONGODB DATABASE.")```
Cy#2501: Not sure
Equity#3464: okie
Xua#1137: why are you calling the check manually <@!636797375184240640> ?
Equity#3464: i think i answered the other question
Cy#2501: What

Kaylynn#4444: <@!455289384187592704> it's for setting per-server command usage requirements
so i have a deco that will check the user-set requirements, and if those aren't present, it'll check the check provided as an arg in the decorator
Xua#1137: why not use `Command.can_run`?
Equity#3464: im so glad that i dont have to look up anymore sql
A Discord User#5290: ?rtfm on_message_remove
R. Danny#6348: Could not find anything. Sorry.
Cy#2501: Todo add Use `can_run` instead of calling internal `predicate`
Todo#9724: Todo task successfully added!
A Discord User#5290: ?rtfm on_message_delete
R. Danny#6348: 
Kaylynn#4444: can_run isn't right for what i'm doing i don't think
because if a user can't use the command with the default requirements (has_permissions in this case) but can use it with the server-specific requirements, it will still fail

R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

R. Danny#6348: `discord.Message` doesn't implement `==`, so `message1 == message2` is not possible.

You should probably compare ids (`message1.id == message2.id`).

This is a hotly debated issue which is why `==` hasn't be added to messages yet. (See Issue #772)

PixelatedToast#9650: ?tag reaction
R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

R. Danny#6348: **Trying to get reactions from a message but getting nothing back?** You need to re-fetch the message - this is because reactions aren't automatically added to existing message objects as they come in.
```python

    msg = await ctx.send('React to this message.')
    await msg.add_reaction("✅")

hi
type hints
xenonsb#9313: ?tag type hints
R. Danny#6348: An example of what a type hint is:

```py
async def command(ctx, member: discord.Member):
```

In discord.py, this will attempt to convert your variable to the type that you are specifcying. In this example, it will attempt to convert the string from the message to a `Member`. For example:

```
!command @R. Danny#6348 
# or
!command 80528701850124288
# or
!command "R. Danny"
# This will end up making the member variable declared in the command a `Member` object
```

In normal python, this does not do anything except for documentation purposes. It allows interpretation of the methods, in order to know what type a variable in the parameters is meant to be. IE an IDE is able to tell you you're passing the wrong variable type, based on this.

Kaylynn#4444: get your cold dead hands off of me
Eugene#3778: ?tag spoonfeeding
R. Danny#6348: **The simple answer as to why we do not spoonfeed, is it does not help you learn.**

If you come in this server and ask a question that has a very basic answer, and you do not know how to figure out this answer...then put quite bluntly, you need to learn more. What we will do, is point you in the right direction to learn what you need to. By simply giving an answer that you, most likely, cannot then figure out *why* it is the correct answer....you learn absolutely nothing.

All developers need to learn some very basic things:
**How to read docs**
**How to read tracebacks/errors**
**How to figure out *where* to look**
    Would your question be better suited to simply google?
    Is your question in the docs, quite clearly?
    If you think about your question, do you think it's probably been asked many times before? Have you tried the FAQ?

Whenever you are "not spoonfed", you are being assisted in how to do one of the above. Don't be unnapreciative, it is the type of help you need, whether you want to admit it or not.

See: `?tag a real token` for an example token.

taaal#6666: ?tag help
R. Danny#6348: **A simple guide to getting help**

In order for us to help, we need relevant information.

Have an error/issues? **Provide the full traceback output. Show code around the error, and any relevant code.**
Something happening different than expected? **Explain what's expected, then compare to what is actually happening.**

Keep in mind that we are not you, we cannot read your mind, and saying something like "My code doesn't work!" or "I have an error." or "This code is broken, why?" or "Can somebody help me?" gives absolutely nothing, and is just annoying. You must provide information that we need in order to look into whatever your question is.

As a courtesy to others, please refrain from pasting large codeblocks into chat. If it's big enough, you will annoy other users in the channel. Please use services such as <https://hastebin.com>, <https://gist.github.com> or <https://ghostbin.com>.

If you don't know Python, hop into <#381963689470984203> and run `?tag lp`. Without a solid knowledge in Python, we cannot properly assist you. Yes, it will take months. Coding isn't just gluing text together. It takes time and patience — months or years.

R. Danny#6348: To shard your bot:
```bot = commands.AutoShardedBot(
    command_prefix="?",
    description="An AutoShardedBot.")```

__Sharding__
Sharding is a nice way to split your bot to smaller, more manageable parts. It is recommended to only use this feature with big bots (1000 guilds or more).

Dutchy#6127: Why use requests
Sebastiano#5005: how should I do that?
Dutchy#6127: ?tag requests
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

lambda#0987: ?tag why rewrite
R. Danny#6348: **Why migrate to the new stable discord.py v1.0 (previously rewrite branch)?**
  • Better documentation 
  • `ctx` always passed
  • `ctx` new shortcuts
  • Websocket reconnections
  • Model-based API
  • Ability for sub-commands to not invoke parent
  • Async checks and events
  • Case insensitive commands
  • NSFW channel checking
  • Full category support
  • Animated emoji support
  • Audit log support
  • Webhook support
  • Improved activity support
  • New raw events and functions
  • Bot and Cog Template creator
  • Python 3.7 compatibility
  • Jumplink support
  • `Guild.get_role` method for O(1) role fetching
  • New Union, Optional, Greedy Converters
  • New Cog model with new methods, cog names and cog-wide command attribute setting
  • Improved bulk message delete handling

Migrating Guide: <https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html>
lambda#0987: ?tag why not rewrite
R. Danny#6348: **Why not?**
Rewrite is stable, but still in active development. It is discouraged to use if:
   • You won't keep your library up to date
   • You won't keep your code up to date with any breaking changes
   • You won't subscribe to news of breaking changes with `?rewrite`
   • You don't want to rewrite your existing code to be compatible

Mellow#0025: ?tag abuse
R. Danny#6348: Discord has a very loose interpretation of API abuse; as quoted by them:

```
American Jake01/21/2018
@Danny automating the API in that way /is/ abuse. Automatically doing "X" every N is generally not a good idea. Where X could be posting a message, changing someone's nickname, renaming a role, changing a channel topic, etc... 

Generally bots should only react to user actions... 

Although, for very large N we generally don't care. But for small N, we do care. Think rainbow bots, etc....
```

"N" is not really defined, as rate limits are not a good thing to try to get very close to. You're going to have to mostly use common sense here, compare how close you are the rate limit, how often you do this, etc.

R. Danny#6348: **Looking to set up a Lavalink server?**
It's pretty simple to do so, and I'll show you here.

**Setup**
Download the latest `Lavalink.jar` from <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases> here and place an `application.yml` file in the same directory. The file should look like <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example> this.

**Starting it**
Cd into your lavalink directory: e.g `cd <directory>`
Run `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
Check that it started successfully.
*You preferably, should use a process manager for this in the future*

**Using it!**
See `?tag lavalink.py` for more information on Lavalink.py, `?tag pylava` for info on the Pylava library, or `?tag waterlink` for more info on the Waterlink library.

Infinity#1806: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`
