Scragly#5146: I'm just slow to do so because it's a bit of a rewrite
Scragly#5146: No rush though.
taaal#6666: len(bot.commands) will count the commands? <:thrinking:597590667669274651>
Ava#4982: anyway I solved it by doing this incredibly stupid thing:

```cpp
struct Foo {
    enum : char {
        a = 'a'
    };
};```
