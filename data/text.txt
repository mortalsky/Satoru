Saksynator#5566: Oh
Fletcha#9630: ?tag emojis
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Lida#6399: ?tag repl.it
R. Danny#6348: `repl.it` is just as worse, if not even worse than Heroku for hosting Discord bots.

**Why?**
To get your bot running 24/7, you need to run a webserver with your bot, which is a trivial task. Sure, you can pull it off, but why not use a cheap VPS instead? (`?tag vps`)
Repl.it also has some of the major disadvantages of Heroku (`?tag noheroku`)
Overall, it is a bad platform to host, and you should stay away from it.
Lida#6399: ?tag vps
R. Danny#6348: Need to run your bot 24/7? Get a cheap VPS.

<https://www.scaleway.com/>- Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by <https://online.net/>, based in Europe.
<https://www.digitalocean.com/> - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide.
<https://www.ovh.co.uk/> - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available.
<https://www.time4vps.eu/> - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania.
<https://www.linode.com/> - More cheap VPSes!
<https://www.vultr.com/> - US-based, DigitalOcean-like.
<https://galaxygate.net/> - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people.

Self-hosting:
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.

Free hosting:
No.  There is no good free VPS hoster, outside of persuading somebody to host for you, which is incredibly unlikely.

R. Danny#6348: Create your own help command by subclassing `HelpCommand` or `MinimalHelpCommand`, then passing it to `bot.help_command`:

```py
class MyHelpCommand(commands.MinimalHelpCommand):
    def get_command_signature(self, command):
        return '{0.clean_prefix}{1.qualified_name} {1.signature}'.format(self, command)

class MyCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self._original_help_command = bot.help_command
        bot.help_command = MyHelpCommand()
        bot.help_command.cog = self

    def cog_unload(self):
        self.bot.help_command = self._original_help_command
```
or, you can set the `help_command` kwarg to `None` when instantiating you `commands.Bot` instance, and write your own.

R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

Ava#4982: sewer main burst does sound bad
I’veGotABlankSpace#8100: <@!319753218592866315> you are the biggest asshole I have ever met. I have done nothing but be nice to you for as long as i've known you. I always stood up for you when people were being dicks to you, I tried to get you unbanned because I liked hanging out with you, I kept messaging you even though you didnt come back because i still wanted to talk to you. 

> don't bring him back
 I fought to get you unbanned, asking multiple times for you to come back, and yet the instant you come back after I get banned, you tell everyone to keep me banned. 

> it shouldn't be on us to keep him not being a dick
You call me a dick yet *YOU HAVENT BEEN IN THE FUCKING SERVER FOR OVER A GOD DAMN YEAR SO HOW THE FUCK WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN LIKE!*

> he stopped responding to my DMs which was sad because I did enjoy hearing him whine about how I have to come back
wow. is that all it was to you? whining? I was trying to be nice to you and stay friends with you, and you call that *whining*?

You know you were the one person who kept me from leaving this server back in 2018 when everyone was being mean to be because i didnt understand something? You were the only one who took the time to slow down and explain to me what I had to do and why I was messing up. That's why I stayed. Because I saw that there was at least one person who was nice and I could trust. If only I had known how wrong I was back then I could've saved the past year and a half of my life.

Dimbreath#0424: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Dutchy#6127: ?tag import
R. Danny#6348: If you need to import a variable from a different python file, it's pretty easy. In your external file, have a variable and set its value (in this example we'll be using a token, and our file name is called `myfile.py`):
```py
token = "blah blah blah" <-- inside of myfile.py
```
Now, in your main file, you can import the file (by name) and get the token by an attribute of the file:
```py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import myfile # <-- import your external file here

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

# code

bot.run(myfile.token)
```
Now, get your ass on some Python learning websites you filthy prick:

Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.

Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.

```There are 3 downsides to using this method.
1) The converters (the type hints) won't be triggered. You need to pass the correct types into the arguments.
2) Checks will be bypassed. You could invoke an owner only command with a non owner and it would still work.
If you still want to run all the checks, see `?rtfm Command.can_run`, which will run all the checks and raise an error if any checks fail.
3) If ctx.invoke was invoked outside of a command (eg eval), the error handler wont fire.

R. Danny#6348: Checks are a way of limiting a command's use in a certain situation.
D.py has a list of inbuilt checks you can find here <https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html#checks>

A check is applied to a command through the use of decorators. These go above or below the command decorator as like in the example bellow. You can have multiple checks for one command.
```py
@bot.command()
@commands.has_role("Cool Dudes")
async def hello():
```
Checks call also be global or cog wide. See `?tag locational checks`
D.py implements a custom check system if the in built checks are insufficient. See `?tag better custom checks toad`

Kaylynn#4444: i'm so goddamn confused
i'm just trying to call a predicate
why are the wrong errors getting raise
Cy#2501: Wat error
Kaylynn#4444: just a base CheckFailure
Kaylynn#4444: when it should be MissingRequiredPermissions or etc
Kaylynn#4444: <cradd

Cy#2501: Is that your custom check
Kaylynn#4444: it's an issue with my custom check yes
Equity#3464: any mongodb users?

MrHouck#6432: yikes
Equity#3464: ok dad so
Kaylynn#4444: but it's not my check that's causing issues
Equity#3464: uh fuck i forgot question
Cy#2501: <:waitwhat:596577409768226816>
Equity#3464: oh yea
Kaylynn#4444: it's uh commands.has_permissions
Kaylynn#4444: i'm trying to call the redicate for it
Equity#3464: since u use motor, how would u detect if the lib is actually connected to mongo
Kaylynn#4444: and i'm getting CheckFailured'd instead of MissingRequiredPermissions'd
Equity#3464: and how does mongo handle stuff when i try to grab shit from nested dicts that may not be nested
Xua#1137: ```py
        try:
            await self.db.abyss.accounts.find_one({})
            self.log.info("MongoDB connection success")
            # dummy query to ensure the db is connected
        except Exception as exc:
            self.log.error("COULD NOT CONNECT TO MONGODB DATABASE.")```
Cy#2501: Not sure
Equity#3464: okie
Xua#1137: why are you calling the check manually <@!636797375184240640> ?
Equity#3464: i think i answered the other question
Cy#2501: What

Kaylynn#4444: <@!455289384187592704> it's for setting per-server command usage requirements
so i have a deco that will check the user-set requirements, and if those aren't present, it'll check the check provided as an arg in the decorator
Xua#1137: why not use `Command.can_run`?
Equity#3464: im so glad that i dont have to look up anymore sql
A Discord User#5290: ?rtfm on_message_remove
R. Danny#6348: Could not find anything. Sorry.
Cy#2501: Todo add Use `can_run` instead of calling internal `predicate`
Todo#9724: Todo task successfully added!
A Discord User#5290: ?rtfm on_message_delete
R. Danny#6348: 
Kaylynn#4444: can_run isn't right for what i'm doing i don't think
because if a user can't use the command with the default requirements (has_permissions in this case) but can use it with the server-specific requirements, it will still fail

R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

R. Danny#6348: `discord.Message` doesn't implement `==`, so `message1 == message2` is not possible.

You should probably compare ids (`message1.id == message2.id`).

This is a hotly debated issue which is why `==` hasn't be added to messages yet. (See Issue #772)

PixelatedToast#9650: ?tag reaction
R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`

R. Danny#6348: **Trying to get reactions from a message but getting nothing back?** You need to re-fetch the message - this is because reactions aren't automatically added to existing message objects as they come in.
```python

    msg = await ctx.send('React to this message.')
    await msg.add_reaction("✅")

hi
type hints
xenonsb#9313: ?tag type hints
R. Danny#6348: An example of what a type hint is:

```py
async def command(ctx, member: discord.Member):
```

In discord.py, this will attempt to convert your variable to the type that you are specifcying. In this example, it will attempt to convert the string from the message to a `Member`. For example:

```
!command @R. Danny#6348 
# or
!command 80528701850124288
# or
!command "R. Danny"
# This will end up making the member variable declared in the command a `Member` object
```

In normal python, this does not do anything except for documentation purposes. It allows interpretation of the methods, in order to know what type a variable in the parameters is meant to be. IE an IDE is able to tell you you're passing the wrong variable type, based on this.

Kaylynn#4444: get your cold dead hands off of me
Eugene#3778: ?tag spoonfeeding
R. Danny#6348: **The simple answer as to why we do not spoonfeed, is it does not help you learn.**

If you come in this server and ask a question that has a very basic answer, and you do not know how to figure out this answer...then put quite bluntly, you need to learn more. What we will do, is point you in the right direction to learn what you need to. By simply giving an answer that you, most likely, cannot then figure out *why* it is the correct answer....you learn absolutely nothing.

All developers need to learn some very basic things:
**How to read docs**
**How to read tracebacks/errors**
**How to figure out *where* to look**
    Would your question be better suited to simply google?
    Is your question in the docs, quite clearly?
    If you think about your question, do you think it's probably been asked many times before? Have you tried the FAQ?

Whenever you are "not spoonfed", you are being assisted in how to do one of the above. Don't be unnapreciative, it is the type of help you need, whether you want to admit it or not.

See: `?tag a real token` for an example token.

taaal#6666: ?tag help
R. Danny#6348: **A simple guide to getting help**

In order for us to help, we need relevant information.

Have an error/issues? **Provide the full traceback output. Show code around the error, and any relevant code.**
Something happening different than expected? **Explain what's expected, then compare to what is actually happening.**

Keep in mind that we are not you, we cannot read your mind, and saying something like "My code doesn't work!" or "I have an error." or "This code is broken, why?" or "Can somebody help me?" gives absolutely nothing, and is just annoying. You must provide information that we need in order to look into whatever your question is.

As a courtesy to others, please refrain from pasting large codeblocks into chat. If it's big enough, you will annoy other users in the channel. Please use services such as <https://hastebin.com>, <https://gist.github.com> or <https://ghostbin.com>.

If you don't know Python, hop into <#381963689470984203> and run `?tag lp`. Without a solid knowledge in Python, we cannot properly assist you. Yes, it will take months. Coding isn't just gluing text together. It takes time and patience — months or years.

R. Danny#6348: To shard your bot:
```bot = commands.AutoShardedBot(
    command_prefix="?",
    description="An AutoShardedBot.")```

__Sharding__
Sharding is a nice way to split your bot to smaller, more manageable parts. It is recommended to only use this feature with big bots (1000 guilds or more).

Dutchy#6127: Why use requests
Sebastiano#5005: how should I do that?
Dutchy#6127: ?tag requests
R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

For more help, see aiohttp's documentation: <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

lambda#0987: ?tag why rewrite
R. Danny#6348: **Why migrate to the new stable discord.py v1.0 (previously rewrite branch)?**
  • Better documentation 
  • `ctx` always passed
  • `ctx` new shortcuts
  • Websocket reconnections
  • Model-based API
  • Ability for sub-commands to not invoke parent
  • Async checks and events
  • Case insensitive commands
  • NSFW channel checking
  • Full category support
  • Animated emoji support
  • Audit log support
  • Webhook support
  • Improved activity support
  • New raw events and functions
  • Bot and Cog Template creator
  • Python 3.7 compatibility
  • Jumplink support
  • `Guild.get_role` method for O(1) role fetching
  • New Union, Optional, Greedy Converters
  • New Cog model with new methods, cog names and cog-wide command attribute setting
  • Improved bulk message delete handling

Migrating Guide: <https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html>
lambda#0987: ?tag why not rewrite
R. Danny#6348: **Why not?**
Rewrite is stable, but still in active development. It is discouraged to use if:
   • You won't keep your library up to date
   • You won't keep your code up to date with any breaking changes
   • You won't subscribe to news of breaking changes with `?rewrite`
   • You don't want to rewrite your existing code to be compatible

Mellow#0025: ?tag abuse
R. Danny#6348: Discord has a very loose interpretation of API abuse; as quoted by them:

```
American Jake01/21/2018
@Danny automating the API in that way /is/ abuse. Automatically doing "X" every N is generally not a good idea. Where X could be posting a message, changing someone's nickname, renaming a role, changing a channel topic, etc... 

Generally bots should only react to user actions... 

Although, for very large N we generally don't care. But for small N, we do care. Think rainbow bots, etc....
```

"N" is not really defined, as rate limits are not a good thing to try to get very close to. You're going to have to mostly use common sense here, compare how close you are the rate limit, how often you do this, etc.

R. Danny#6348: **Looking to set up a Lavalink server?**
It's pretty simple to do so, and I'll show you here.

**Setup**
Download the latest `Lavalink.jar` from <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases> here and place an `application.yml` file in the same directory. The file should look like <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example> this.

**Starting it**
Cd into your lavalink directory: e.g `cd <directory>`
Run `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
Check that it started successfully.
*You preferably, should use a process manager for this in the future*

**Using it!**
See `?tag lavalink.py` for more information on Lavalink.py, `?tag pylava` for info on the Pylava library, or `?tag waterlink` for more info on the Waterlink library.

Infinity#1806: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

For reasons, see `?tag noheroku` or `?tag dannycalmlyexplainswhyherokuisbad` or `?tag dannyexplainswhyherokuisbadbutitsnotdannyitsdevonssignificantlyandobjectivelybettertag`
SebbyLaw#2597: ?tag noheroku
R. Danny#6348: - Bots are not what the platform is designed for. Heroku is designed to provide web servers (like Django, Flask, etc). This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.

- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.

- Heroku's environment is volatile. In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.

- Heroku has minimal system dependency control. If any of your Python requirements need C bindings (such as PyNaCl binding to libsodium, or lxml binding to libxml), they are unlikely to function properly, if at all, in a native environment. As such, you often need to resort to adding third-party buildpacks to facilitate otherwise normal CPython extension functionality. (This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on heroku.)

- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free programme for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.

clam#5985: should I learn c++?
clam#5985: idk if im ready or whatever. ive heard it's a pretty steep learning curve
Equity#3464: you're always ready
Equity#3464: just gotta put some effort into learning it
clam#5985: can I use vscode
Equity#3464: ya
clam#5985: awesome
clam#5985: ill start tomorrow
Equity#3464: unless you wanna use visual studio which is absolute garbage for cross platform dev
clam#5985: i dont like vs
Nomad#2440: ?tag db
R. Danny#6348: Want to store your data? Here are some ways:
Format: `**DB** -- python libraries to interface with it`

**PostgreSQL** -- `asyncpg` (good for general use)
**MySQL** -- `aiomysql`
**SQLite** -- `aiosqlite` (good if your bot is small and/or private)

Note while JSON *can* be used if it's a small/simple bot, care must be taken in order to avoid losing your data.
Equity#3464: just use mingw since it provides all the tools for c and c++ dev

clam#5985: ive technically been programming for like 10
Equity#3464: i've been programming for 2
IAmTomahawkx#1000: but only the last like 5 months has been comprehensible python
clam#5985: but really programming for like 3
Equity#3464: html was my first language
IAmTomahawkx#1000: cause it was all self taught
Equity#3464: then css
Equity#3464: then python
clam#5985: i started learning js when I was like 5

Cy#2501: I started programming a year ago lol

IAmTomahawkx#1000: ?tag raw oop
R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of \`object\`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a \`Class\` and an \`instance\` .

A \`Class\` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a \`Class\` of \`Fruit\`....an instance of this class could be \`apple\`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
\`discord.Guild.id\`

This \`id\` attribute is an attribute  of the class \`Guild\`....This means to use it you must have an \*\*instance\*\* of the \`discord.Guild\` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: \`message.guild\` through searching by id \`client.get\_guild(id)\` etc.

TL;DR: \*\*OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.\*\*
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

Format: `**DB** -- python libraries to interface with it`

**PostgreSQL** -- `asyncpg` (good for general use)
**MySQL** -- `aiomysql`
**SQLite** -- `aiosqlite` (good if your bot is small and/or private)

Note while JSON *can* be used if it's a small/simple bot, care must be taken in order to avoid losing your data.

IAmTomahawkx#1000: pip install supervisorctl right?
Xua#1137: just supervisor i think
Equity#3464: tbh just use ur os repos
Xua#1137: bleh no
Xua#1137: those are usually outdated
Xua#1137: plus installs unnecessary python versions sometimes
Xua#1137: pip version just works straight out of the box
IAmTomahawkx#1000: is there a setup.py?
IAmTomahawkx#1000: it didnt run one
Xua#1137: nop
Xua#1137: well
Xua#1137: there is
Xua#1137: but it has no unneeded setup
Equity#3464: tru
Xua#1137: once you call `supervisord`, you can call `supervisorctl` to load the cli
IAmTomahawkx#1000: theres no supervisord bash thingy tho
Xua#1137: did you install it globally
IAmTomahawkx#1000: yeh
Xua#1137: ie in root / without --user
IAmTomahawkx#1000: 
IAmTomahawkx#1000: oh

Cy#2501: ?tag systemd howto
R. Danny#6348: First create a `.service` file, located in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. You can find a template for it by doing `?tag systemd example` (in <#381963689470984203> of course).
Now assuming the file is named `mybot.service`, run these commands:
- Reload systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
- Start you bot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mybot
```
- If you want it to automatically start on boot:
```bash
systemctl enable mybot
```
And that's basically it. Of course, this tag doesn't cover all what systemd can do. You can get more info by visiting the systemd wiki: <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>

Cy#2501: ?tag systemd howto
R. Danny#6348: First create a `.service` file, located in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. You can find a template for it by doing `?tag systemd example` (in <#381963689470984203> of course).
Now assuming the file is named `mybot.service`, run these commands:
- Reload systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
- Start you bot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mybot
```
- If you want it to automatically start on boot:
```bash
systemctl enable mybot
```
And that's basically it. Of course, this tag doesn't cover all what systemd can do. You can get more info by visiting the systemd wiki: <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>

R. Danny#6348: Tag not found. Did you mean...
supervisord howto
super
Cy#2501: ?tag supervisord howto
R. Danny#6348: Install it with pip

``pip install supervisor``

Run ``echo_supervisord_conf > /etc/supervisord.conf`` to get a basic supervisord conf file, it also can be in whatever dir you want, this is the default one. 

Append this to it. 
```ini
[program:bot]
command=/bin/bash -c 'source venv/bin/activate && venv/bin/python bot.py'  ; activate venv and start bot
directory=/full/path/to/bot ; if you dont want to always run supervisord from the specific directory set this
autostart=true ; start the bot as soon as you launch supervisord
autorestart=true ; restart the bot when the process dies
stopsignal=int
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true ; for cleaning up and avoid spawning multiple processes
stderr_logfile=/etc/logs/botstderr.log ; log to a file
stdout_logfile=/etc/logs/botstdout.log ; log to a file
```

Then, in your bot's directory run ``supervisord``. If supervisord.conf is not in the ``/etc`` dir make sure to to include the ``-c path/to/file.conf`` flag. 

You can then use ``supervisorctl`` to check the status of your processes, restart, stop or start them.

For more config options check out the official docs http://supervisord.org/configuration.html

□ | The Cosmos#6811: ?tag blocking
R. Danny#6348: **Using blocking code in your bot?**
Code that is computationally intensive or slow such as PIL, blocks the entire event loop, meaning that your bot cannot process other events, such as messages, during the time that the blocking code is running. If you want to run synchronous code asynchronously, you will need to do it in another thread. Using `await loop.run_in_executor(None, sync_func, *args)` does this for you.

R. Danny#6348: Need to run your bot 24/7? Get a cheap VPS.

<https://www.scaleway.com/>- Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by <https://online.net/>, based in Europe.
<https://www.digitalocean.com/> - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide.
<https://www.ovh.co.uk/> - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available.
<https://www.time4vps.eu/> - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania.
<https://www.linode.com/> - More cheap VPSes!
<https://www.vultr.com/> - US-based, DigitalOcean-like.
<https://galaxygate.net/> - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people.

Self-hosting:
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.

Free hosting:
No.  There is no good free VPS hoster, outside of persuading somebody to host for you, which is incredibly unlikely.
Soheab_#5757: ?tag jishaku
R. Danny#6348: jishaku is a debugging and experimenting cog for Discord bots using discord.py@rewrite.
Note that this only works with Python 3.6+ and discord.py rewrite.
You can install it by running the following:
```
pip install -U jishaku
```or
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku
```
To get the cog running, simply do
```
bot.load_extension('jishaku')
```
You can see the source code yourself here: <https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku>

flapili#5132: ?tag db
R. Danny#6348: Want to store your data? Here are some ways:
Format: `**DB** -- python libraries to interface with it`

**PostgreSQL** -- `asyncpg` (good for general use)
**MySQL** -- `aiomysql`
**SQLite** -- `aiosqlite` (good if your bot is small and/or private)

Note while JSON *can* be used if it's a small/simple bot, care must be taken in order to avoid losing your data.

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+i
2. Click "Network" tab
3. If you do not see any rows, start typing in a channel to generate a network request
4. Click on one of the rows
5. Scroll down to "Request headers"

R. Danny#6348: Discord disabled the easy route of getting your token via `Application`, so I've provided 2 other ways of doing it. Please note, self-bots are against the TOS, so make sure not to use them! 
**Method 1:**

`1` Press CTRL + Shift + I
`2` Find "Network"
`3` At the top type in "/api/v6"
`4` Type a few letters so this appears: http://i.emil.ink/u/DiscordCanary_2019-05-09_18-43-58.png
`5` Scroll to the bottom where it says `Request Headers` and copy the `authorization:` code (that's your token)

**Method 2:**
`1` Open CTRL + Shift + I
`2` Go to "Application Tab"
`3` Expand Local Storage > https://discordapp.com/ 
`4` Log out of Discord
`5` Log back into Discord
`6` Your token will be there, and you can copy and paste it now.

R. Danny#6348: **Oh no! You just leaked your bot token!**

You accidentally gave out your token in a screenshot or in your code and forgot to remove the token! What does that do?
Well, it leads to letting users access your bot acccount/controlling it.
Don't worry, you can reset your token anytime!

You only have to go on **https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/** and generate a new token under the bot tab.

Make sure next time you don't leak your bot token.
Always keep in mind that you have to remove the bot token before taking a screenshot or sending your code to get help.

F4zi.#1107: ?tag class
R. Danny#6348: A class is a very important part of Python. If you don't know anything about Python, please take the time to learn it (run `?tag lp`).
**What is a class?**
A class is a way of creating objects. The object have variables and behaviors within them.
**How do I make one?**
You can create a class by using the keyword `class`
**Show me an example**
Sure, anything to make this tag longer
```py
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def test(self):
        print("Looks it works! :)")

# Create an instance of a class
example = Example()
example.test()
```

F4zi.#1107: ?tag instance
MrSnek#3442: ?rtfm load_ext
R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

Lida#6399: ?tag reactionroles
R. Danny#6348: To create a "reaction roles" system you need to wait on reactions on older messages- which will not be in the 5000(default) long cache discord.py maintains- and if a message is not in the cache, `on_reaction_add` will not dispatch for reactions added to that message.

To resolve this, on the **async branch** you can use `on_socket_raw_receive` and parse the events "manually", and get the "raw event" that way- see `?tag on_socket_raw_receive`, which will provide you with several dicts with relevant IDs.
On the **rewrite branch**, `on_raw_reaction_add` is provided, which will trigger for all reactions regardless of cache, and provides you a `RawReactionActionEvent` object containing relevant IDs.

Use the IDs in these objects to filter out reactions relevant to messages and emojis you care about, and get relevant role/member objects.

R. Danny#6348: **A simple guide to getting help**

In order for us to help, we need relevant information.

Have an error/issues? **Provide the full traceback output. Show code around the error, and any relevant code.**
Something happening different than expected? **Explain what's expected, then compare to what is actually happening.**

Keep in mind that we are not you, we cannot read your mind, and saying something like "My code doesn't work!" or "I have an error." or "This code is broken, why?" or "Can somebody help me?" gives absolutely nothing, and is just annoying. You must provide information that we need in order to look into whatever your question is.

As a courtesy to others, please refrain from pasting large codeblocks into chat. If it's big enough, you will annoy other users in the channel. Please use services such as <https://hastebin.com>, <https://gist.github.com> or <https://ghostbin.com>.

If you don't know Python, hop into <#381963689470984203> and run `?tag lp`. Without a solid knowledge in Python, we cannot properly assist you. Yes, it will take months. Coding isn't just gluing text together. It takes time and patience — months or years.

nx#1674: ?tag database
R. Danny#6348: <https://www.postgresql.org/> - Widely used, open source database with good data integrity and feature set. The typical recommendation for bots.
<https://www.mysql.com/> - The de facto SQL standard in software development. Usually not recommended here due to the decreased feature set in comparison to PostgreSQL, but strongly time-tested.
<https://www.sqlite.org/index.html> - File-based DB, no authentication. Lack of networking means query-by-query time is relatively fast, but tends to chug past a certain amount of load.

i want to delete this message sent by user where he/she used the command
Arcane#0033: OH
😉 Ashu 😉#0690: i know there is self.purge or self.delete
Arcane#0033: just do ctx.message.delete()
😉 Ashu 😉#0690: 🤔
Arcane#0033: inside the command
😉 Ashu 😉#0690: Oh ty
Arcane#0033: np
Arcane#0033: but wait... <@!563143458806824980>
Arcane#0033: idk for real but it might delete the message object
Arcane#0033: so you might not be able to access ctx.message again
Arcane#0033: so you might want to store the information from the message you need in variables

Danny#0007: Hello, the first event is officially over 🎉

It ran a *little* bit longer than I originally wanted due to some sudden real life circumstances but hopefully it was still fun for everyone involved. First some data:

Feb 6: 63 Infected, 1 Death
Feb 7: 41 Infected, 0 Deaths
Feb 8: 95 Infected, 19 Deaths
Feb 9: 53 Infected, 2 Deaths
Feb 10: 50 Infected, 24 Deaths
Feb 11: 44 Infected, 12 Deaths
Feb 12: 37 Infected, 12 Deaths
Feb 13: 14 Infected, 43 Deaths
Totals: 397 Infected, 113 Deaths

Top curers are AnonymousDapper#7467 and Cute#0313 being tied for 10.  Total number of people cured by someone else is 62. A little overinflated due to bugs though.

Top killers are tied between Kaleido 𒆙 Cli#2705 and AXVin#2130, both with 4. The total number of people killed by someone else is 27.

The person who infected the most people is apple502j#6852 with 11. Second place doesn't even come close at 2 infected. The total number of people infected by someone else is 36.

I don't have per-day statistics on being cured (sorry) but the total of cured users is 108. This number might be a little overinflated since there were a few bugs with the hug command.

The code for the bot will be public at some point. I've prepared a longer Q&A if you're curious about certain things here: <https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/623debe0433d064ec263f6da00666de4>

As for feedback, if you liked this event and would want to see more in the future (with completely different themes etc) then react to this with a <:upvote:596577438461591562> , otherwise react with a <:downvote:596577438952062977> .

Gobot1234#2435: im not that dumb
devon#4089: oh i see it's string literal concat abuse
LyricLy#5695: now this code is kinda bad
MrSnek#3442: Jesus
Shiney#0001: mmmmm
LyricLy#5695: remember what I just said about no list comprehensions
LyricLy#5695: yea
Danny#0007: eh
devon#4089: <@!319753218592866315> it's fine as long as it's not the only thing in your f-string
Danny#0007: this isn't really abuse
Danny#0007: lol
LyricLy#5695: oh I get what you mean
MrSnek#3442: `client.user.friends` <:thonkeng:582078279301726258>
Gobot1234#2435: its not dpy
LyricLy#5695: like putting sole code in an f string
devon#4089: yes
Danny#0007: it ain't me
LyricLy#5695: technically faster than casting to string sometimes though isn't it
devon#4089: `f'{<a string>}'` is pointless
devon#4089: str.join returns a string
Gobot1234#2435: thats big brain
LyricLy#5695: very true
devon#4089: so you gain nothing from this except from i guess the concat stack above
LyricLy#5695: the one thing I hate in Python is string literal autoconcat
LyricLy#5695: dumb
Gobot1234#2435: yes
devon#4089: it's useful sometimes
Shiney#0001: ```py
>>> f"{'string'}"
'string'``` i have released my anger
devon#4089: yes this hurts me
devon#4089: very much
Gobot1234#2435: is beatiful
MrSnek#3442: Was it too much trouble to use triple quotes?
devon#4089: f-strings as triple quotes makes visual alignment look terrible
devon#4089: but that aside
devon#4089: triple quotes also consume whitespace
Ava#4982: I see a lot of people do `f'{stuff}'` for some reason

Shiney#0001: oh right

Shiney#0001: i generally dislike f-strings anyway so
devon#4089: it hurts me when the thing inside the expression returns a string
LyricLy#5695: how does the bot have friends?
devon#4089: like with the str.join case
Gobot1234#2435: <@!310418322384748544> do you prefer .format
Shiney#0001: yes
devon#4089: it's literally already a string
Gobot1234#2435: <@!319753218592866315> its steam
devon#4089: shiney why are you against f-strings
devon#4089: they're shorter to write and faster at runtime
Shiney#0001: they look stupid and people abuse them
devon#4089: but shiney
Shiney#0001: if i wanted fast i'd use c
devon#4089: i can do `f"The current date is {datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}"
devon#4089: aint that fuckin suck
Shiney#0001: most of my time is spent **reading** code
if your stupid f-strings are my bottleneck for reading your code
i will despise you and your code
devon#4089: in my opinion this ^ is much more readable than the .format alternative
Shiney#0001: that looks okay devon
Shiney#0001: yes
Shiney#0001: but people take it far further than that
Gobot1234#2435: do run py
print(f"The current date is {datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}")
RTFM#1338: ```ph
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".code.tio", line 1, in <module>
    print(f"The current date is {datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}")
NameError: name 'datetime' is not defined

Exit code: 1```
Shiney#0001: you'll see a full line of code in the string and think "what the fuck does this do"
Ryan#5872: abusing convenience is the main issue of it
Shiney#0001: mostly because my ide doesn't actualy syntax highlight f-strings lol
Gobot1234#2435: do run py import datetime
print(f"The current date is {datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}")
devon#4089: if you're heaping statements in there then you're just really bad at code readability
RTFM#1338: ```ph
The current date is 2020-02-13

Exit code: 0```
ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag permissions
R. Danny#6348: To see all available permissions in the Discord API and calculate the correct permission value for Permissions objects or Oauth URLs, use the following website:
<https://discordapi.com/permissions.html>
Shiney#0001: mhm
Shiney#0001: this is my main problem
ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag permission overwrite
R. Danny#6348: **How to set permissions overwrites for bots™**

Permissions overwrites are permissions specific to a channel which override the default ones.
If you want to edit the overwrites for a specific member you can do something like this
```py
overwrite = discord.PermissionOverwrite() # can also be discord.PermissionOverwrite(send_messages=False, ...) 
overwrite.send_messages = False
overwrite.read_messages = True
await channel.set_permissions(member, overwrite=overwrite)```or 
```py
await channel.set_permissions(member, read_messages=True, send_messages=False)```

When creating a channel though, it's a bit different. You have to provide a dictionary where each key is the target and each value a discord.PermissionOverwrite object, like this:
```py
overwrites = {
    guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=False),
    guild.me: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True)
}

await guild.create_text_channel('bot-only', overwrites=overwrites)```
In both cases, if you want to delete them set the ``overwrite`` kwarg to ``None``.

You **cannot** set or edit overwrites through ``channel.edit()`` and you **must** have the ``manage_channels`` permissions so set/change them.
Shiney#0001: no they're bad because of the people who use them c:
Shiney#0001: that's how this works
devon#4089: i want to hear your opinions on religion shiney
Shiney#0001: fwiw i'm kidding
Shiney#0001: also lol
Shiney#0001: devon i think i may have made my handshake not fucked
devon#4089: yeah? run it by me
Shiney#0001: first, i forgot how you figure out the server to connect to
Shiney#0001: don't you need the room code for this
devon#4089: i forget let me check my own lib
Shiney#0001: alr
LyricLy#5695: <@122122926760656896> I did not know you could do that, that is fukin sick
LyricLy#5695: the datetime thinf
LyricLy#5695: strftime with __format__
devon#4089: 
devon#4089: yes you need the room code
Shiney#0001: dumb
Shiney#0001: have you ever seen it not be ecast?
Shiney#0001: because that's what i've hardcoded
devon#4089: well it needs to connect you to the right server that's hosting your game
devon#4089: the framework they are using does not mandate that it is ecast so your code should not assume that is ecast
devon#4089: opportunity for it to fail sometime in the future inexplicably
Shiney#0001: yeah i know this
devon#4089: blobcast is the only URL suitable for hardcoding and you only need to communicate with it once to know where you need to be from then on

Shiney#0001: checks out
LyricLy#5695: shiney
LyricLy#5695: eyes were closed sorry
Shiney#0001: did you just fucking call me whiney lmao
Shiney#0001: best misspelling of my nam

devon#4089: what port are you connecting to
Shiney#0001: uh lemme check

devon#4089: yes it's expecting the time
Shiney#0001: how's that look
devon#4089: i dunno how it reacts without it but the official client passes it
Anakin#1267: ?rtfm guildinfo
R. Danny#6348:

devon#4089: ?t=<unix integer timestamp in milliseconds>
Shiney#0001: i have no idea what purpose is serves
devon#4089: "javascript time" as we call it
Shiney#0001: how do you propose i get javascript time in python :')
devon#4089: int(time.time() * 1000)
Shiney#0001: `wss://{0}:{1}/socket.io/1/websocket/{2}`
Shiney#0001: and this is the wss to connect to
Arcane#0033: wew
Shiney#0001: is my handshake okay now >:c ~~after i add time param~~
devon#4089: yes but you are supposed to validate your session code
Shiney#0001: how in the world do i do that
Nivrak#6560: ?rtfm on_message
R. Danny#6348: 
Poteto143#1434: e!info
devon#4089: the /socket.io/1 returns <session_code>:60:60:<other_info>
Shiney#0001: yeah
devon#4089: <other_info> needs to contain `websocket` for it to be a valid socket and you should probably check the numbers are right too
Shiney#0001: `code:60:60:websocket,flashsocket`
Shiney#0001: what're the numbers
devon#4089: i am not sure because the original code doesn't help explain them
devon#4089: they don't appear to be important other than they're consistent
Shiney#0001: so they're always 60?
devon#4089: yes
Shiney#0001: easy enough
Shiney#0001: so, add time, check `...:60:60:websocket,flashsocket`
devon#4089: yes
Shiney#0001: woo
devon#4089: then when you connect to the socket you should check the first thing you receive is `1::`
devon#4089: and your immediate response to it should be the JoinRoom action including your name and room code
Shiney#0001: actually should i be checking `websocket,flashsocket` or just `websocket`
devon#4089: websocket is the only one that matters
Shiney#0001: got it, then steal the first recv and check it's `1::`
devon#4089: flashsocket is presumably for if the player is using flash
devon#4089: probably old version stuff
Shiney#0001: i see
devon#4089: if you do that and send the right JoinRoom code and heartbeat 📥 `2:::` 📤 `2::`
devon#4089: then your handshake is ok
devon#4089: also use blobcast
Cy#2501: K.sockres
Kanade#5520: 
Shiney#0001: blobcast thing is annoying
Shiney#0001: i connect in `connect()` and i join in `join(code)` lol
i'd have to merge them to choose a server from the room code :c
Cy#2501: K.snipe <#381965515721146390>

devon#4089: just store it on your class then
Shiney#0001: this doesn't change anything lol
Shiney#0001: connect comes before join
Shiney#0001: and would need the code join gets
Shiney#0001: <:dabThinkGlare:454742395662106625>
devon#4089: wtf is your control flow man

devon#4089: def connect():
    self.server_location = ...
Shiney#0001: <:dabThinkGlare:454742395662106625>
devon#4089: yes you need this anyway
Shiney#0001: ```
connect() # doesn't get the room code
join("....") # does```
Shiney#0001: i do not usually need this until i am *joining*
devon#4089: how are you getting your app id
Shiney#0001: why would i need appId
Shiney#0001: also it would be in join if i do lol
devon#4089: because you need to send it back on the websocket
Shiney#0001: y'know after you join an "app"

R. Danny#6348: jishaku is a debugging and experimenting cog for Discord bots using discord.py@rewrite.
Note that this only works with Python 3.6+ and discord.py rewrite.
You can install it by running the following:
```
pip install -U jishaku
```or
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku
```
To get the cog running, simply do
```
bot.load_extension('jishaku')
```

Programmer#5648: ?tag custom emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

Kaylynn#4444: ?tag lavalink
R. Danny#6348: **Looking to set up a Lavalink server?**
It's pretty simple to do so, and I'll show you here.

**Setup**
Download the latest `Lavalink.jar` from <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases> here and place an `application.yml` file in the same directory. The file should look like <https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example> this.

**Starting it**
Cd into your lavalink directory: e.g `cd <directory>`
Run `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
Check that it started successfully.
*You preferably, should use a process manager for this in the future*

**Using it!**
See `?tag lavalink.py` for more information on Lavalink.py, `?tag pylava` for info on the Pylava library, or `?tag waterlink` for more info on the Waterlink library.

Marvin#9972: ?tag instance
R. Danny#6348: Python is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language...it uses the concepts of `object`s to house information about things. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a `Class` and an `instance` .

A `Class` defines what an instance of said class will look like, and an instance is an object created based on that class. An example would be a `Class` of `Fruit`....an instance of this class could be `apple`. 

An example seen in discord.py is this:
`discord.Guild.id`

This `id` attribute is an attribute  of the class `Guild`....This means to use it you must have an **instance** of the `discord.Guild` class. This can be obtained in a number of ways, through a message: `message.guild` through searching by id `client.get_guild(id)` etc.

TL;DR: **OOP is a very base concept of python, if you do not understand OOP then learn this first before creating a bot.**
(Yes, static methods and classmethods exist....this is only detailing the basic class/instance interaction)

LittleEndu#0001: ?tag typehint
R. Danny#6348: An example of what a type hint is:

```py
async def command(ctx, member: discord.Member):
```

In discord.py, this will attempt to convert your variable to the type that you are specifcying. In this example, it will attempt to convert the string from the message to a `Member`. For example:

```
!command @R. Danny#6348 
# or
!command 80528701850124288
# or
!command "R. Danny"
# This will end up making the member variable declared in the command a `Member` object
```

In normal python, this does not do anything except for documentation purposes. It allows interpretation of the methods, in order to know what type a variable in the parameters is meant to be. IE an IDE is able to tell you you're passing the wrong variable type, based on this.

randomSphere#4274: ?tag greedy
R. Danny#6348: A special converter that greedily consumes arguments until it can’t. As a consequence of this behaviour, most input errors are silently discarded, since it is used as an indicator of when to stop parsing.
When a parser error is met the greedy converter stops converting, undoes the internal string parsing routine, and continues parsing regularly.
For example, in the following code:
```py
@commands.command()
async def test(ctx, numbers: Greedy[int], reason: str):
    await ctx.send("numbers: {}, reason: {}".format(numbers, reason))
```
An invocation of `[p]test 1 2 3 4 5 6 hello` would pass numbers with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and reason with `hello`.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

ShadowHanzo#2108: ?tag reboot
R. Danny#6348: The only good way to restart your bot is to shut it down and have your process manager handle it. You can shutdown your bot by running `Bot.close()`.

Do use:
* run your bot in a process manager such as:
  - systemd
  - openrc (gentoo, devuan)
  - runit (void linux)
  - supervisord
  - upstart (old ubuntu)
  - docker
* manually reboot it 

Do not use:
  - a bash loop (it can eat your C-c by rapidly spawning python and if your bot fails it won't stop it from constantly failing)
  - subprocess.call (you will eat your memory up by not letting your old processes die)
  - os.exec*

Nomad#2440: ?tag api abuse
R. Danny#6348: Discord has a very loose interpretation of API abuse; as quoted by them:

```
American Jake01/21/2018
@Danny automating the API in that way /is/ abuse. Automatically doing "X" every N is generally not a good idea. Where X could be posting a message, changing someone's nickname, renaming a role, changing a channel topic, etc... 

Generally bots should only react to user actions... 

Although, for very large N we generally don't care. But for small N, we do care. Think rainbow bots, etc....
```

"N" is not really defined, as rate limits are not a good thing to try to get very close to. You're going to have to mostly use common sense here, compare how close you are the rate limit, how often you do this, etc.

R. Danny#6348: **Use aiohttp.**
`requests` and `urllib` are blocking. Do **not** use these libraries within your asynchronous code. 
(http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

discord.py uses `aiohttp`, so it should already be installed. An example of code using aiohttp and discord.py:

```py
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as cs:
    async with cs.get('https://httpbin.org/json') as r:
        res = await r.json()  # returns dict
        await ctx.send(res['slideshow']['author'])
```

empty embed
lee#3386: ?tag json
R. Danny#6348: JSON is **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation, a serialization format for data.
Advantages of JSON are:
- It is a common data exchange format and has been around for a long time, so many languages will support JSON either in their standard library or with minimal dependencies.
- It provides a common format that can be used to shift data between languages, programs or machines.
- It has a lightweight syntax so minimal space is wasted.
- The syntax can be pretty printed to be made more human-readable.

Disadvantages of JSON are:
- Some languages do not have direct parallels to JSON objects, making them difficult to manage in said languages.
- There may be considerable processing overhead serializing and deserializing to/from JSON.

1) The converters (the type hints) won't be triggered. You need to pass the correct types into the arguments.
2) Checks will be bypassed. You could invoke an owner only command with a non owner and it would still work.
If you still want to run all the checks, see `?rtfm Command.can_run`, which will run all the checks and raise an error if any checks fail.

Xithrius#1318: ?tag emoji
R. Danny#6348: **How to show emotions for robots:**
Custom emotes are represented internally in the following format:
`<:name:id>`
Where the name is the name of the custom emote, and the ID is the id of the custom emote. 
For example, `<:python3:232720527448342530>` is the name:id for <:python3:232720527448342530>

When sending *standard* unicode/discord emojis, you just send the unicode character. This is handled differently from language to language, but in python, you can send  `\N{NAME}`, the codepoint, `\uFFFF`, or just the unicode char itself: `🇦` You can get info on this by using the ?charinfo command

You can quickly obtain the `<:name:id>` format by putting a backslash in front of the custom emoji when you put it in your client. 
Example: `\:python3:` would give you the `<:name:id>` format.

When **adding reactions**, you can either send the unicode for standard emojis, or send `name:id`, *not* `<:name:id>` for custom emojis.
*New in 1.1.0* You can use `<:name:id>`

**Animated emojis** are the same as above but have an `a` before the name- ie: `<a:name:id>`

R. Danny#6348: **How do I add a reaction to a message?**
There are a few ways to do it, firstly, you need the emoji you want.
For basic (non custom) emojis, this can be either:
**The Codepoint** `\u2705`
**The Raw Unicode** `joy`
**The Name** `\N{MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING}`
For custom emojis, you will need to specify it in a format similar to:
`name:id` for static emojis, or `a:name:id` for animated emojis.
Note that you must NOT have the **`<>`** in the reaction.
Or an alternative way,
`discord.PartialEmoji(is_animated (True or False), name, id)`

**How can I use to add a reaction?**
`await message.add_reaction(<your emoji>)`
